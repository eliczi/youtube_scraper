1,"Disagreed. This is completely what I expected out of Zay, not in bad way. Smooth beats, calm flows and basic to the point lyrics. Wasn't mind blowing but I like it. I like the simplicity. It's a vibe. Favourite tracks were Darkseid, RIP Young, Claymore, True Story, Chad, Hey Mista, Score, Lay Wit Ya, Headshots, Wat U Sed, From The Garden, HB2U and THIB. Lay Wit Ya took a while to grow on me though, completely in love with it now. I liked Demo and Tirade better, but still good.

2,"I’m actually surprised at the reaction to this album…like I got pretty much exactly what I wanted…smoove beats, cryptic,simple, yet relatable lyrics that hit home..and yeah that’s pretty much it. I was annoyed at all the features tho..I just wanted More Isaiah but I also feel like that’s kinda a selfish thing of a fan to ask an artist not to work with people. But yeah I’d give it a strong 7.. gave me exactly what I wanted out of an Isaiah project.",1K,Jordan fayyo,10 months ago,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYDeOj_j2DaSM0dC99C4KVQ

10,Isaiah does mention in an interview that he intentionally made his features feels as if it was their song.

11,"Woah, I loved HB2Us second beat. It gave me a real strong Beatles- Abbey Road feel. It almost sounded like Isaiah’s attempt at something similar to what Mac was doing with Circles.

19,"Also, this album to me was about a man who was still guarding himself from having to talk about the very public struggles he’s had to overcome in the past 5 years. From the obvious desire to not talk about how his past 5 years have been, to the low-key flows and moody vocals, to even the distortion effects he so often uses on this LP to masks and hide what he’s saying. I think it’s an incredibly subtle and really interesting theme, and I’m not sure if he consciously decided to put that at the forefront, but it’s really what wraps up the album for me. The sounds of a man who’s overcome but is still too wary to let you see the scars just yet.",17,Relica,10 months ago,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrvVsbeDxPmQ-owDhBJAHDA

23,"I really like Isaiah Rashad, a lot, but Isaiah Rashad sounded lazy most of this album. This is lyrically his worst album, by far, and the features out rap him a lot. I'm kinda sad because I was excited to hear from him again, but the lackluster lyrics combined with the bad engineering making his voice even more lazy, I don't care for this album much.

30,"You have no idea what you're talking about, this is a contemporary masterpiece that draws from some many influences to create something even bigger.

He's brilliant ",,Jordan Sarvar,5 months ago (edited),https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2r5035P6fGqUIvgG_IKDHg
31,"I loved this album, I would personally give it an 8.5/10. I can understand where Anthony is coming from, in regards to his comments about production, energy, and contrast with the featured artists. That being said, my love for this album lies in the narative and the way he expresses it. The way he ties together his cadence and tone seems to be purposeful in the way that it matches the energy of the track. Lazy beat, lazy flow. Energetic beat, energetic flow with staccato. I find value in the way Rashad highlights those featured on his tracks. It provides the atmosphere of collaboration instead of one-upsmanship. Rashad is willing to be the unique Instrument in a production without ""having to solo"" constantly.",2,Josh Hinman,8 months ago,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiFHtTNzvl59Zcrc6ZONE-w

37,"I don't think the album is a masterpiece or anything but definitely thought it was better than Fantano did. But that's ok with me. None of us are forced to watch him or to have the same opinions as him, we seek out watching his reviews because we respect his opinion even if we don't agree.

41,"Although upon first listen I wasn’t a huge fan, I’d say every single track on this album has grown on me and I have had it on repeat since it’s dropped. 

Personally, I don’t think Isiah’s verses and vocals are super stand out on this album and I think it’s easy to agree that his vocals blend in to the tracks, but from what I can tell this is intentional. He said it an interview himself, that he’s more of director than a writer/rapper. ",,Bumperknickle,10 months ago,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR_Xg_PKEEQ2zw29Yk2yzBA

47,I really enjoyed the first half of the album. It starts teetering off for me towards the end. I still go back to the Cilvia Demo. That album is a contender for rap album of the decade,27,hammerman2006,10 months ago,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRLp0RkgGMuTwxzukFdNtTw
48,I think it’s the best total listen I’ve had this year but I like good music from 70s classic of Earth Wind and Fire and parliament/Funkadelic to OutKast and Goodie to whatever is soulful. I understand that some people hear music while other people feel music…the connection is different. The way it makes you move your body in response to that connection is different. So I’m not surprised cause without that connection you probably can’t really feel the beauty. I’m from Memphis and this album is bumpin… blues and funk like OutKast’s Atliens. So yall really asking too much of this reviewer. He’s probably doing the best he can do.,1,Rod Lo,10 months ago,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRr9f1b32Fd7Wl4rTx-pNeQ

53,"i agree with Fantano a lot, but when i disagree with him i disagree with my entire being. how anyone could describe a Zay song as ""soulless"" is baffling to me, and pretty much everything Melon criticized this album for is exactly what i love about Isaiah's music. wishing an Isaiah Rashad song was more complex and animated and highkey is like wishing water was less wet... like wtf",,bulma_999,1 month ago (edited),https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp-e1YDhMNs0UlWd2kwIjdQ
54,"So I just watched the review for a second time to see the point from Isaiah Rashad about fantano critiquing his identity. Which he did not. The main takeaway is the presentation of the topics in each song is bland-not critiquing the black experience-how Isaiah is outshined by the features, and lastly how Isaiah doesn't sound very energetic, which of course we can all say was not his goal for the most part but that's really just a preference that Fantano prob doesnt like vibe type music. Nowhere in the review did he talk about his or the black identity. I don't understand where Isaiah got this idea in his head, like all he sees is a white man who didn't like his album and thinks he's talking about him s a person",6,basthejokester,9 months ago,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO7afsPEs1uHWzm5HoM0cYQ
55,Damn. I loved this album. I don’t know specifically what it is about zay cause I normally have the same complaints about nav and gunna but sum bout zay I’ve always really liked.

73,"So I will say this, originally I would have agreed with almost everything he said on first listen. The singles didn't do to much for me either and the whole first listen I was left wanting so much more.. I left the album for a day and came back. I started to enjoy it slightly more. By the 3rd listen I was picking out some substance. And by the 4th and 5th listen I was thoroughly enjoying the album. Once I got over the initial disappointment, there was alot to enjoy on this album. I could leave it on rotation and not have to skip a single song. Everything just starts to blend together in a very smooth and relaxed way that starts making sense. His other 2 albums have a few jarring tracks on them and some instrumentals and voice inflections that you either love or hate. But this album really just floats in the back of your brain as you keep picking up hints of internal or problematic issues of the world, however it's almost left up to your interpretation, like on the title track ""thib"". If you really enjoyed his last 2 albums but are feeling let down by this one, I would suggest leaving it on repeat and just let it ride, when your in the car, at home or playing games. I thought it was a downside at first, with him sort of blending into the tracks, however now it starts to make more sense.",38,Bassaholic91,10 months ago,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxjjGbdzf7QB_FuQVsRjQeg

93,"honestly, the album is best depending on how you are in the moment. It's a great chill album that is good to listen while being high but it was a bit of a letdown for those that wanted more from him since he gave a lot of years for fans to wait and snippets of bars that were never released in the songs he provided. The vibe it goes for, is a good back to back with the sun's tirade but for older rashad fans there's like one or two songs are reminiscent of his civia demo era. Though his houston vibe he had in his old stuff is still heavy in this one and I respect that.",,Mysteryyoshi LP,10 months ago,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtdsxYiaUhyfk7PnjgpARNQ

194,"Say what you will about this review, but Isaiah’s response to Fantano on Twitter is just not it. Isaiah has a right to disagree with Fantano’s opinion, and he has a right to be very upset about it, but to completely discredit Fantano as a music reviewer is silly. Saying things like “he’s just doing it for views” and “he’s too white to understand” is such an immature viewpoint. Like, he’s clearly not doing anything for views. For one, Fantano reviews everything, from huge artists to underground artists that people have never heard of, it has nothing to do with views. Also, a lot of people want to know what he has to say, so there’s a demand. Trying to discredit certain groups of people from critiquing art is also another terrible thing. So, I’m black, and because I’m not white/Italian, I’m not allowed to critique Renaissance art? The moment you create art for anyone to see, everyone who sees/listens/experiences that art has a right to comment on it. Fantano is not reviewing the black experience or black lives, he’s reviewing the MUSIC, and he didn’t like the music. It’s such a silly thing to bring race into this conversation when his review has nothing to do with race. He’s stated many times that he isn’t black and can never comment on black experiences sung/rapped about in music, so he sticks to commenting solely on the music. I love Isaiah Rashad, and all of TDE, but I’m super disappointed in their responses to Fantano and I hope Fantano is well and doesn’t feel bad. Isaiah needs to understand that this isn’t a personal attack and that Fantano only wants him to succeed. Whenever somebody critiques your work, you should try to take in and understand the criticism, and, hopefully, use it to try to improve your later work. And if you feel really hurt by a review, either keep your thoughts to yourself, or try to be a bit more mature and reasonable when saying things publicly.",148,Kevin,10 months ago (edited),https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDSikW1Vc46eXz5VoytZjaA

199,"Honestly if you aren't a very vibey person or a stoner, there isn't too many qualities in Isaiah Rashad's music that will make you like it tbh. His lyrics are decent at best, production is sleepy and predictable almost 90% of the time (unless you have the occasional banger from him like park, wats wrong, banana, or shot you down), and his delivery is incredibly monotone to the point where I deadass can't understand what he's saying on the mic because it sounds like he's going to sleep. There's alot of artists that I don't like, but I can see qualities that they have that make people like them and their music, but with Isaiah... I really don't see it. Plenty of other musicians/rappers that make better chill vibey music than him in my opinion, like curren$y, dom kennedy, boldy james, smoke dza, big krit, etc.",1,MrASAPAB,10 months ago,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2CgaLf2qqfZyYd6OAiMpYw

He changed the og beat ""from the garden"" and replaced with in my opinion a much shittier beat. There were a few tracks I did enjoy but if your gonna tell me that this album was better than cilvia demo with tracks like Heavenly Father, Ronnie Drake, RIP Kevin Miller, Modest. Or what's wrong, free lunch, park etc. It doesn't even come close. And after waiting a long time for this project I just felt really down about it. Just my opinion. This album wasn't the worst. But it won't leave mark like the other albums. Still will always be  a Rashad fan though. At least we got some good tunes.

It’s way too long to wait for an album that doesn’t stand up to being as great as the period of time it took to make!

The only thing I give him is when he first came out I thought he was just a Kendrick clone, but with the sun tirade and this he is definitely his own man and has his own style.

I agree that track with Jay Rock was weak on Isaiah Part, he even said in an IG live that he didn’t vibe with the beat and was surprised he put that song out. I disagree that the project is a 5, I’d give it a low 7 as a whole project.

I don't think I've read a music review in over 10 years lol. Now videos and articles on music history and production are actually interesting. Who seriously needs someone to tell them to listen to something that takes less than a minute and no money to check out yourself. And then tell you or reaffirm an opinion on their musical tastes? You have your OWN taste and you don't need anyone to pat you on the back for what YOU like.

Doesn’t make sense to review albums from an artist you don’t enjoy especially when you are making the review based off of your subjectiveness rather than technique and form. Pretty bad “critiquing” when you continuously inject your bias into the review. “I didn’t enjoy this.” “I didn’t enjoy that because it was boring to me.” It being “boring” to you isn’t a critique, at least not a well informed one. That’s not being a critic, anyone can post a video on YouTube stating whether they liked or found something something boring or not… how do you have 2.2 million subs?

I haven’t found a review of his that I’ve felt added to the listening experience or my perception of the album. In a way, you as a viewer of his have to try to understand his perception and in a sense- review his reviews. I don’t think my mans understands black culture, but that’s my opinion. I, like many others, do believe he delivers low scores consistently in order to attract views. Regardless, it’s his right to do what he wants.

1683,"This album sucks. Its crazy this is on a major label. minus the features, it seems like something an underground rapper would release for free. i can also tell this guy specifically has no ambitions to be anything more than a minor cult hit for guys who like YouTube ""chillout"" playlists. So why is he on a major label? Someone really heard this and thought ""yeah this is going to be big""? Its simply not engaging enough.",,Bill Fraser,10 months ago,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_DKkMfbTmOSSARHBCfur7Q

1692,"@theneedledrop you are just showing destructive criticism, if you have nothing really but bad to say about this wonderful artist who got #1 on the charts for a reason then you are just looking for a way to come to terms with more viewership, being a critic is out weighing the good and the bad but it seems as the you where out for him! Hey atleast you got you’re 5mins of famebut also got a less lack of respect from you’re actual listeners. Proof is in the pudding you!
