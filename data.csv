I have binge watched a dozen of your episodes since you got recommended to me
"""During this sales period, over 130 wireless headphones were sold worldwide."" I mean... You're not wrong..."
"Surprised you didn’t talk about the environmental impact. AirPods have a small battery and delicate components that degrade quite fast, and everything is sealed in meaning repairs aren’t possible without breaking them. This essentially means AirPods are a consumable product which has huge implications on the environment. E-waste is already a massive problem and these aren’t helping."
"Removing the headphone jack is and always was a SCAM. The problem with high quality cabled headphones was they didn't die every year and a half, you didn't lose them, you could still use them in ten years time. And worst of all you didn't buy them from apple. Obviously all bad things that needed to be stopped."
"1:28 that argument they made about the 3.5mm jack being outdated and ""limiting"" the progress of audio was absurd. It's the most basic and reliable way to send an audio signal, and any wireless audio signal is going to make compromises. Yes, AirPods are more convenient than a cable, (Galaxy Buds Pro daily driver here btw) but they marketed it as a ""quality"" issue and not a ""convenience"" issue."
"'Courage.'

It's a fukkin eadphone, Apple me mate. Made by literal slaves. Not the second coming of Brian."
"You can make anything sound good if you add “courage” in front of it.

“The courage to tell a lie.”
“The courage to drop out of highschool.”"
"I found AirPods Pro on the beach, I thought it was a shell only to realize it was the case top. I felt bad for the thousands of people who loose AirPods in the sand, they must be almost impossible to find. (Yes they still worked, named them lucky beach ;-)"
That apple guy speaks a dialect of English where the definition of courage and money are switched around.
"I am still firmly in the corded headphone camp. 
 The fact that they remove the cord, and then sold you another cord so that you wouldn’t lose the headphones… 
Pure insanity"
Jesus. I never knew they actually said “courage” was the reason they went to lightning only.
"Me: Doesn't like Airpods
Anecdotal Evidence from everyone I know - Airpods are the best earbuds ever.
One British Internet Lad: Airpods suck.
Me: Confirmation bias my old friend I KNEW it."
I’ll be shocked if this isn’t just one long advertisement for Raycons.
I always wondered what it would look like if someone mashed together Tom Scott and Jacksepticeye into one person.
"While airpods themselves are overpriced garbage, the amount of low profile, low cost, quality wireless earbuds to hit the marketplace after their success has been an absolute blessing. Currently watching this video on a pair of Utaxo earbuds I got for like $35 a year ago, and the sound quality is good, the battery last forever, and they're tiny so they're super easy to wear at work without being super obvious"
"I've always found ear bud style things annoying as hell. I've had a pair of bose over ear wireless headphones since 2016, and I gotta say I've been quite happy with them. They're starting too look very well used but still function like new."
"Moral of the story: Wired headphones are the immortal invention that will never lose its usefulness no matter how much your humiliated into buying airpods. Because apparently it's 'cool', 'hip', and 'trendy' to lose an airpod and violently s*** out $1000 for another pair JUST to replace the other one :)"
"The greatest type of earphones are the bluetooth wired ones, you don't have to worry about losing one of them or getting them tangled, while having the best of both types of earphones"
airpods good because the case goes snap and looks like the girl robot in wall-e
"Also, having bluetooth on always, all the time, even when your pods pass out... Is a massive security risk... I suppose Apple didn't have enough courage to develop an accessibility feature, or setting which allows your phone's Bluetooth to only connect to your buds, then immediately turn off if disconnected....  Or some other protection that would really have been considered"
I currently severely dislike Apple for making their core devices: computers unserviceable / non upgradable. That is an utter crime
I've always wondered about the history of pointy shoes (Both female or male long formal pointy shoes) or shoes in general. It would be cool if we got a video on them at some point. :)
"I have the Sony headphones... they sound amazing, they have unbelievable noise-canceling, they're much cheaper, they look really cool and really subtle, and they come with an aux cable so you can use them forever"
"""Why did you run over all those children?"" Courage."
The way he called it a “CULTference” lmaoooo so true
"I don't understand the tampon string. Why can every other manufacturer fit all the internals in the earbud, but Apple needs the tampon string to fit everything?"
"You always manage to look like someone thawed a caveman out and took him to an outlet mall

And tbh, it's becoming my favorite aesthetic"
"I once saw someone say ""all fidget spinners look like dollar store knock-offs regardless of their actual price or quality"" and tbh that's how I feel about airpods and other wireless earbuds. I do prefer them because I just seem to get the cords of regular headphones caught on stuff all the time, but I've basically never seen a pair that looks like it deserves its price point"
They were right about flash though. Mobile flash was never anything more than a hot mess and only would’ve prolonged the streamlining of mobile browsing
"I got my first set of Bluetooth ear buds for $30 from Amazon. They mostly work great. I usually wear only one so I can still hear the outside world, and then the other one is fully charged when the time comes to switch, which is actually quite rare for me.  I don't worry quite as much about losing them, since they're so cheap. I should buy a couple more sets."
It is physically impossible for a person to be this underrated
"I feel like a minority when i say that my airpods are my favorite earplugs/headphones of all time. the only thing i dislike is the price but all of the negative points mentioned in this video i dont agree with. although they are white, they are the most discrete, unlike the competition which produced some unholy monstrosities (samsung, boze), the sound isnt the best but its good, they NEVER fell out on their on, even during light jog or sprint, the bluetooth never failed me and ive had mine since 2018, they work fine and ive never lost a single piece. And i will always give Apple the edge because the have a history of producing earphones that dont require to penetrate your entire ear canal to stay in place"
"If you start replacing the word ""premium"" with ""idiot tax"" in your daily live, things like AirPods start making a lot more sense."
"I’ve had my AirPods since March 2018, before the hype. I’m using them right now. I’ve never lost them, they’ve never broke, basically I have had no issues with them whatsoever, yet I agree with everything you’re saying."
"Weird to me hearing someone defend wires. I was actively looking for wireless eadbuds in 2012. I nearly kickstarted quite a few pairs from 2014 to 2017. That's how desperate I was to kick the wire.

Doesnt matter how much you spend or dont spend on wired earphones.. the wire for at least one of them will die way too early. They get in the way, and they are awful to run with."
"You didn’t even mention the environmental/disposability of AirPods and how unrepairable they are, and you still had a compelling argument. Well done."
"As someone who has gone through at least a thousand dollars on headphones, earbuds, etc in the past.
I'd say the best headphones I've ever had, and the ones I still use today are just the generic $25 chinese bluetooth ear buds.  With raycon everyday as backups"
"One thing wireless earbuds are great for is wearing them under my helmet while driving my motorcycle. I use a no-name brand pair I bought for 30 dollars for that exact purpose. Other than that, nothing beats good wired headphones in terms of audio quality."
"listening to this through my AirPods Pro on my MacBook Pro, getting notifications on my Watch 6, and I forgot how much I hate myself"
"I'm glad you're a fellow wired headphone user. No need for freaking airpods.

Alot of people seem to want the same phone, same headphones and same watch as each other. I don't get why the hype."
Apple gets away with too much
"I find that I rewatch your videos every couple months, they’re so entertaining and well written, and you’re really charismatic"
Great video as always. I’ve gotta correct just one thing: you can definitely get just one AirPod though if it goes missing. They’re around $70 apiece.
"Love it, good video. I will say as someone who grew up listening to CD players on the school bus with crappy wired headphones, having Airpods in 2005 would’ve been like owning hoverboard."
"To be fair, I've bought a pair of wireless earplugs, and I love'em. But mine have a noise reduction rating, sound amplification for hunting and conversation, and they're practically impossible to knock out- all for about the same price as Airpods"
"I have a pair of those Sony XM3s and they're pretty great. The noise cancelling mode is basically air tight, good sound quality. Pretty pricey when I bought them though"
I was hoping you'd comment on the e-waste aspect! Wired headphones can last for decades but once the batteries go bad on Airpods they can't be replaced! Yet Apple still tries to argue they care about the environment...
"A video suggestion: Would be great if you could make a video explaining one of the most shocking UK dating shows called ‘There's Something About Miriam’ which was aired back in 2003. Essentially, guys from the UK (including George Best’s son) are all given the task to win over the heart of the beautiful and mysterious girl named Miriam for the winner to eventually find out she’s a transgender"
"Thank You so much for making content. 
You really made my last week so far. 
Been binging your videos after work every day now till sleep.
Your humor, style and informative description of things are very well done and I just love it."
"It wasn't courage, they knew that their costumers were dumb enough to buy a phone with less characteristics at a high price."
"THANK YOU! Finally, I always felt left out because I refused to give up my headphones to transition to a wireless earbuds."
"Got this vid on my homepage ca 3 weeks after buying my first pair of AirPods. I bought Airpods Pro after upgrading to a iPhone as a workphone. I cannot describe the magic I feel using the Pros, the amount of tech thats been stuffed into those small little things is incredible. I agree to them being expensive, but I personally think its worth it. Use mine all day. Fun video, but i disagree on almost all points."
"The things I like about a wired set: is that. I don't have to charge them, pair them, or fear losing one. I just have to deal with annoying cable management. I'm going to keep using wired stuff as long as possible."
"As a weird thing for me is that I tried some inexpensive wireless headphones and i enjoyed the convince as long as I took some time to charge them in the day. But for ear comfort I haven't found a headphone that is as comfortable as the apple head phone design. I'm not a fan boy it's just the most comfortable for my ear, so AirPods"
"""Loyal Kool-Aid chuggers"". I laughed too hard at that."
I feel like I'm missing something here. There are a ton of brands of wireless headphones so what makes the Apple brand any different except providing a matching set when included with an iPhone?
"my favorite part is that thanks to apple, other manufacturers are catching on to how pants on head idiotic their customers really are, and have started deleting headphone jacks from their products."
"If only we had a premium sounding alternative. Perhaps at half the price of other earbuds. 

A man can dream."
"Didnt see the wastage of Airpods metioned, specifically how its not possible to replace the battery in them or repair them at all.
but it was covered pretty well if you lose one, the attitude is just ""buy them again!"""
"Eventhough I use wireless earbuds, I love the fact that I can also use wired ones on my Samsung, because sometimes I use my bigger wired earphones at home."
I wouldn't call them a ''life-style'' accessory when the unreplaceable battery dies within 2 years.
"When airpods first came out, I saw people at my school with them, but I had no idea what they were. I thought kids were wearing broken ear buds as a fashion statement or something."
"I must say that as someone who used to get my cables caught up on things, I like my fully wireless earbuds"
"Perhaps the biggest drawback of bluetooth headpones in general (in my mind) is security. If you're walking around a bustling area with an active bluetooth connection, it's just another ingress point for any malicious actors who know how to use that connection to their advantage. Keep your bluetooth off if you aren't using it! Of course... wired headpones don't have that issue "
"I would just like to tell you that I have now watched everyone of your videos and am waiting patiently for more, seriously good stuff and your the type of channel that gets me watching more youtube then television these days. Ive literally reccomended you to friends which is lame and i wish i didnt, still good stuff."
"Apple: doesn't include chargers, cables, headphones in the box; says it's to save the environment
Also apple: develops another device that you constantly have to charge"
"Ironically enough, the sound quality per dollar for wired in-ears has exploded since Apple (and several Android manufacturers) made their ""courageous"" decision."
Now I know where you get ONE of your eccentrical influences from. I'm convinced that there is a copy of Catch-22 on your bookshelf at 8:18. You have the ability to channel the mental gymnastics of Joseph Heller in your fantastic videos. Please keep making these great talkies? All the best - from a convict in Australia.
"""flimsy plastic apostrophes"" - love it! "
The fact that he knew what “reality distortion field” meant really impresses me and tells me that this guy does genuine research on this stuff.
I’ve actually thought a lot about how quickly the attitude towards airpods shifted. Great vid.
"""Don't let the bastards grind you down"" sounds really cool and something you can put on a shirt or similar clothing."
"Apple: wants you to believe they know what they're doing.
uses the word courage, a word typically associated with defiance
Apple: surprised customers defy their notion of superior intellect."
"My favorite was when they gave it to NBA players to use while they shot warm up shots and made sure the cameras were on them lol, definitely worked on the hype beasts"
"Can we also take into account that with a phone older than a couple of months, having bluetooth turned on will drain the battery faster than the airpods run out of juice"
Wearing noise cancelling headphones while walking around in a city is like giving pickpockets an invitation to rob you.
"I am current using a $40 adapter to charge my phone and listen through speakers to this at the same time. Yes, $40 out of my pocket because of their “courage”"
"Always thought they looked so stupid, like it's supposed to look wireless, why have the ""stems"" at all.  dead apple dude is turning in his grave"
"7:00
""Over 130 wireless headphones were sold worldwide""
I mean it's technically true"
I could listen to you for hours. Great commentary skills.
The irony of Apple being named after something easily available and cheap.
"I came across this video today, never having watched this dude in my life but with years worth of YouTube experience and classing my self as a connoisseur of YouTube videos I thought I’d give it a try... I thought I’d seen and heard it all and could see things coming however...."
"I really like AirPods and started using them as someone interested in tech when they first released. I also have airpod pros as well and they are even more excellent as someone with autism when I visit loud and chaotic environments. However, as much as I like them, the fact that the battery is pretty much impossible to replace and that they wear out so quickly is a massive waste problem. "
I watched this when it came out and laughed at the idea of airpods thought they were stupid. Now im rewatching with airpods in my head holes. 
"I thought that it's an unnecessary product first, but after using them, I found a lot of new use cases where wires wouldn't work. To name a few: working out or using them
with your tv."
"Around this time was when I got a Bluetooth earpiece from Amazon for like $10. Sure it was just one ear, but that was fine for sitting and listening to music/podcasts at work while still being able to hear someone talking to me. Plus the buttons on it let me scroll through songs easily without needing to look away from what I’m doing (especially if I’m driving)."
"You are so underrated, found you from iternet historian's pirate video and watched ALL your videos (I have to stay at home because of quarantine)  so thank you so much for your content, love the topics, love even more the jokes. I tried to share your videos to my friends but they don't speak english so..
ps: the song in the moon videos SLAPS, had to rewatch it 3 times"
Just found your fabulous channel as we go back into lockdown. Ready to binge watch my day away thank you 
I'm kinda surprised that Apple can make good sound quality with wireless but that In itself isn't saying its the best achievement to do since their wired audio shucks
The last time I ever wore any Apple earphones was their first gen wired ones. The only ones that managed to stay in my ears on their own. Every new shape afterwards just tended to slide out and not stay in.
And yet they still basically single-handedly made wireless ear buds standard
"I will say that a good compromise is the Bluetooth earphones where both pieces are connected by a wire. I've got some cheap Anker one, sits round my neck, has a control unit on the wire with a charging port, great battery life and actually less hassle than regular wired earphones and airpod style ones"
"You opened with the darkest dystopian commercial, and it gets darker from there."
"I always knew these were bullshit and kept my way better sounding, cheaper over ear headphones. Glad to see someone calling them out"
"Plenty of content, and all of high quality. Good job with the channel, Ordinary Things."
"I remember when those things came out. ""No. Id rather have reliable wireless charging for my phone instead."""
"""If you like your planet flat and vaccines the FUCK AWAY FROM YOU"" 
gold, my friend"
"I do have to say that my offbrand wireless headphones have lasted two years, lasts 12 hours, cost 20 bucks, and takes three hours to fully charge.

It's taken so much abuse, its comfortable, doesn't pop my eardrums because it's inside my ears. "
"I wonder if his tin foil hat is just a large funnel wrapped in tin foil, or if the entire thing is 100% tin foil. This is a true conspiracy. Funnelgate is here."
"Growing up in a Macintosh household in the 90s, getting a two button mouse in the early 00's and discovering I could change the background on my fathers desktop was a revelation."
"Remember when apple wasnt going to include chargers or headphones with the iphone 11 or 12 or whatever for ""environmental purposes""? Because i do. Scummy company"
When he first came up with the tin foil hat. I laughed so hard. 
"Wireless headphones are cool if your work requires you to move around an office. For me, as an architecture student, I can listen to music while drafting on the drafting table, then easily go to the classroom trash or to the modelmaking place in the classroom. When I used headphones with wires, sometimes I'd get up from the table and accidently pull my phone along. "
You forgot to mention the two most important things (at least for me and many musicians). Streaming music through Bluetooth is alway going to be worse quality and since many people use iPads and iPhones for music making these days loosing the mini-jack plug is really stupid move.
"I used wired cables when running, but after having multiple mp3 players flung around by said cable I decided maybe this is not the best option for my smartphone.
Switched to wireless cable connected headphones until I ended up realizing that if the cables on the wired headphones was flimsy, it had nothing on wireless headphones."
"I’m sorry. Ive been screwed over way too many times by wired headphones with loosening connections between either the cable and the one headphone, or between the cable and the jack. I’ve even  had a wireless headphones that had a wire between the buds lose connection. True wireless is far superior imo"
"AirPods: Crimes against the head

AirPods Max: Crimes against humanity"
"I mean I love my Bluetooth headphones, but I also love that my Samsung allows me to use my wired backup pair when I can't find mine.... I dont know how many times I've gone skiing and had one of my iPhone friends be unable to listen to music because they forgot their dongle"
The only reason I need to keep using wired headphones is that they sound a lot better than their same priced wireless counterpart.
"Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  This video has helped my hatred for everything Apple grow even stronger "
"I got air pods as soon as they were avaliable to buy, I think they’re convenient. Not worth the price, but I would never bother bringing earbuds that I have to untangle out to public, and I just use headphones or speakers at home"
"Had mine for two years, never lost one, always been great. Good for blanking life out."
"7:05 ""over 130 wireless headphones were sold""

you're not wrong, but..."
"I got my brother a set of semi-wireless headphones for Christmas. No wire between the buds and the device, but a wire between the buds that goes behind your head. Best of both worlds imo"
"""Ordinary, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"". With yelling, and ire, and well directed obloquy. Some of my favourite things."
"You missed the worst part: OTHER brands got rid of their headphone jacks because of this, infecting the rest of the market."
"Wow! These air pod things sound so cool! If only I didn't have hearing aids and be unable to use them, thanks apple!"
"Uhm, you definitely can buy them individually, I'm pretty confident I did when I lost one, either that or I bought a new case when I put it through the washer"
"My earbuds don’t have wires, they are just AirPods with a leash so I can take them for afternoon walks"
"""...air of exclusivity, even though everyone was buying them."" 

Well, not everyone. Some of us aren't idiots."
"“This is terrible!”
Comments while listening on AirPods"
"I just stumbled upon your channel for the first time, I love your style and videos! Thanks for making this!"
"I had wire earphones and had much more problems with them. The first problem was the sound difference. My left earphone had a louder sound than the right one. The second problem was with wire. When I was climbing up the stairs, my earphones had a chance to stuck in the railing. I broke them this way. They tangled on the railing like spaghetti on a fork."
You've become my favourite YouTuber with literally one video! Ever since I heard you on Sundance rejects I was like this guy rocks
it will forever mystify me how apple consistently convinces the world that the absolute worst version of any type of product that exists is a mega desirable luxury item
"You're sticking with the wires and me too


BUT NOW WE CANT PLUG IT ANYWHERE  BECAUSE they removed the hole. and the extender refuces quality significantly"
"Consumers don't exactly care unfortunately, I know people who've lost dozens of these things and still go back and buy more"
"I mostly only like them because I don’t have a wire tugging at me when I’m doing strength training. But yeah otherwise I shared all of your qualms. And for the Airpod Pros, they stayed in
my ears WORSE than the original ones when I was running. So I had to get memory foam tips!"
Surprised you didn’t mention how absolutely awful they can be for your hearing. In ear headphones can do more damage to your ears in a shorter time than a rock concert!
I got my “AirPods” from 5 below with a rechargeable case for $8.00. They work great so far and if I flush one I won’t cry.
"I'll be just sticking to my Shure SE425 plugs, wired variant. I bet the sound is better anyway.
If I ever find myself wanting wireless, all I need to do is switch the detachable cable (!) for the wireless cable module, or even just the tiny true wireless extensions that secure it over the ears. Try to beat that kind of flexibility/modularity..."
"Not having flash was a actually a good move, can't say the same about removing the headphone jack though"
"In my experience, the wire on wired headphones wears out so quickly that I need to buy another $20 pair every couple of months. Plus the wire is just extremely annoying in general, getting caught on clothes and door knobs and just about everything else."
"Feel a bit like a commercial, this one.
PS: wearable tech to the extreme: “environment through” mode, when you’re spoken to... now you don’t have to take them out!"
"I go through headphones too fast to buy a pair for that much money.
And I also like the fact that the cable keeps them together, on my body, plugged into the phone without them getting lost.
Ever tried to find a dropped micro SD card. On a parking lot. At night?"
Nah I would still find it more amusing to use my brain once in a while to solve that spaghetti mess of wires for like about a minute or two rather than wasting hours in frustration trying to find the other Airpod. Also I don't have to care about battery or them falling out like those damn nerf darts you lose after playing. Or maybe it's just me lol :)
"Apple is the reason i went from being mocked for having an old school ipod, and wired headphones in 2011, to being constantly asked where i find my gear. 7 years later and the 300 bucks i spent on head phones and ipod are still going strong."
"On-ear/Over-ear headphones will always be king. No needless kafuffle with in-ears falling out every 10 seconds, let alone being an earwax magnet."
"“Courage” is something I never thought people would say about Air Pods

I feel like I have courage because I have air pods"
Yo you were straight on with the meme marketing concept at 5:05. I’ve always wondered if the same type of marketing was used by Netflix for Bird Box cuz that was undoubtedly one of the most shit movies I’ve ever seen for how hyped it was.
'The courage to spend years denying the paternity of the same daughter that I named an Apple computer model after.'
"I just realize from this video that your jokes and comedey writing style or brutal and straight to the point and it’s unique and I like it,Even though I try to avoid those types of things to avoid buyers remorse."
I'm annoyed I'm only just now discovering this brilliant channel but also stoked I now have a back catalogue to procrastinate with 
"Wouldn’t the “AirPods Max” just make you a massive and irresistible target for theft, especially in the dense outdoor urban environments that their advertisements are typically suggesting?"
"For me, who like biking, they're pretty good. Main feature is that they're wireless, which is pretty good when you have a phone in your pocket and your legs are swinging around constantly, they let me have a helmet on, and do not block out outside audio, so I can at least hear the horn of the drunk driver plummeting towards me on red at 80kph BEFORE I meet my maker"
When my neighbor runs out of m-th he starts screaming and yelling along with beating pans against the walls. The ANC in the Air Pods Pro does a great job at canceling out his sober tirades. It’s the only product that allows me to pretend drug addicts don’t exist.
"""After a year like this, $500 to be blown off planet sounds like a bargain"" I love this channel. I love you. You pronounce nuclear like George W. Bush."
"Honestly airpod charge has never been an issue for me, mostly bc I use one at a time so I always have one available"
"They have a point with the wires though, many economists say that all the wires we have to throw out the price if copper gets higher, if everyone used reliable wireless earbuds the prices of media listening devices would go down"
Earpods are so uncomfortable. I'll never understand why Apple thought they were being smart with this design. It's horrible.
"7:02 ""during this sales period, over 130 wireless headphones were sold worldwide"", Holy crap, that's like 65 pairs."
"I don't own airpods, but I do find bluetooth headphones to be amazing for any physical activity while listening to something. For example, doing chores while listening to a podcast. I used to get my earbud cords snagged so often when doing chores. Having bluetooth headphones is a massive improvement. But if I wasn't moving around it wouldn't matter so much."
We just gonna skim over the fact that apple's 'one size fits all' earbuds are uncomfortable as all hell? Those things fell like I'm cramming legos into my ear canal.
"I think the number one success from Apple, and well, most giant tech companies actually, is making people thinking they ""need"" the feature the product offers. I never really believe noise cancellation in earphones. I'd rather use a proper headphone to actually do the job better, and without having to crank up the volume to make my ear bleed."
Waiting patiently for more content from this channel. I need it!
"Honestly if Bluetooth was more consistent and higher quality I wouldn't mind this change, but unfortunately Apple wanted to push the idea years before the actual tech was ready.

Absolutely nothing can compare to the sound quality of even the most average of wired headphones."
"Connected wireless headphones are sweet. Hard to lose, can just hand on neck if needed, people can actually understand you when you angle the mic."
"dude, you're super awesome to watch and listen to.
thoroughly enjoying your stuff, but...
sure we're all entitled to our own opinions and what not, i just believe you should put more thought into shunning vaccines and vaccination as a whole. "
"""Lets hope next year is better for all of us.""
Me: Looks at date ""So much for 2021..."""
"I’m so excited about actually finding you as you take off my friend. I have a habit of falling in love with a channel just as it falls unfortunately, almost to the point I thought I might be contributing to their demise? No, great channel, I’m trying not to overwatch you to eek you out until your next video. You’re ok I’m a harmless weirdo "
"Man it's wild how much your channel has blown up in the last month. The algorithm dice rolled in your favour and I'm so happy for you. Finally getting the views and subs that you deserve. Fuck yes, man."
"hmmm, you've got quite a strong opinion lol. My airpods have been the best change I've made. I've never been able to keep a wired earpods to last more than a few months, and I've had my airpods without issue for nearly 2 years now. So for me, the minor annoyances are 100% worth it, cause even wired earpods have their own set of annoyances too."
"Hello. Absolutely love your channel. Thank you so much for your great and funny work. I wanted to if possible request a video about the particularly evil business of pay-as-you-go/in-app purchase-based mobile games, including Marvel Contest of Champions and Candy Crush, to name some of the more evil ones (evil but also, dumb people like myself for buying into it) I lost several years and thousands of dollars to MCOC and would love for you to shed light on how lots of these games apply the same algorithms (love that vid too) as casino slot machines. It used to be you'd buy a (console) game for 40 or 50 bucks and that game included everything, like a good book (?). No worries if not just requesting. Also, a video about socks would be cool. Thank you again. Be well."
I have a pair of wireless ear buds that also act as hearing protection. They have foam ear plugs on the inside and microphones on the outside that allow you to hear through them
Ironically the best earbuds I've ever owned are a pair of $50 Beats flex. Comes with a neck holder so you can't lose em and they auto pause when you tap the buds together.  Funny that a subsidiary made such a superior product.
"Now, I get what your saying about wired head phones being just as good. But, Raycon man specifically told me, ""Raycon good, wires bad"". And I'm inclined to believe him."
"I'm surprised that you didn't mention how airpods don't have different tips, so that people would hear their music better and wouldn't fall out as much"
My favourite thing about this channel is the slightly off yet still completely accurate word choice
"YouTube recommended your Tinder video to me, and it was pretty interesting. But it opened a rabbit hole of content to me tonight. I am really enjoying your channel and have binged over 10 videos at least. 
Between Pokemon cards, Micky Ds and malls, this channel feel like a modern history channel that touches the roots but fast forwards to the last decade or two."
"My main question is why, WHY WOULD YOU MAKE THE PIECE THAT GOES INTO YOUR EAR PLASTIC, after a while they seriously start to hurt"
"i have the sony earubds shown in that funny japanese commercial and they're amazing.
when it comes to the hardware issues, having the freedom to build not only the drivers and the casings but also the amplifier and signal processing components does mean you can go higher than before when it comes to sound quality.
regarding waste, obviously no one cares."
"I've got to be honest. Airpods... pro may I add, for clarification reasons, of course ... are the only apple product that I have ever bought and they're really good.

The noise cancellation is a godlike feature and I've did a bunch of research on similar products and apple appears to be really good value for money."

The videos release date was heavily based on when OT could get his hands on a giant airpod"
"It really does come down to lifestyle though. I used to love to make fun of people with those dumb things in their ears, but then I became a dad. And guess who likes to yank cords? Babies! Now to be honest I can’t imagine going back to wires even though I do lose them a lot lol"
Apple consumers complaints about Apple screwing them over have made me laugh for over 30 years now LOL 
One thing that people need to remember is that wired earbuds also just kept dying all the time - the wire would break over a short period of time
"I just got a pair of $15 wireless earbuds (finally found some without the little rubber pieces yaaaaay) from a Dollar General, and honestly? They're pretty decent. Worth the $15.

Not gonna buy anything from Apple, though."
"To be honest, i love my airpods, i would NEVER go back to normal headphones. I don't have an IPhone but airpods are even on Android "
Remember when they used to say Bluetooth Headsets caused brain tumors.
"I like my wired earbuds because of the quality and ability to connect them anywhere, like listening through a mini amplifier. But for commuting, I connect my wired earphones to a small Sony Bluetooth receiver, that way I don't have to worry about the cable grabbing into something. I guess, I might be a hybrid technology user."

"god dammit, ordinary things! this is my new favorite channel and i watched every video of yours and now i have to wait for more! this is bittersweet:("
"I’ve lost my air pod pro in a 8 foot pit of hog shit for a hour before I fished it out with a magnet, still works perfectly."
I use decent but cheap wired ones since I'm chaotic and I like to still hear my surroundings when I'm cycling to work :)
"I got AirPods in summer of 2018 with my own money when I was 16. At the time, nobody had AirPods and a lot of people made fun of them lmao, crazy because now everyone has them"
"This is why I only use eco friendly, ethically sourced Raycons. you people do realize I'm memeing right?"
"I still stuck to my wires. I’m a music nerd, and a wired connection is almost always superior in sound quality, even if you go as cheap as $40"
I’m also of the impression to keep my $10 headphones which I still lose. Also Bluetooth isn’t great for audio but I collect records which off gas and have worse audio quality. So...
I actually bought a pair of air pods pro back in July. The reason was I was going on a family vacation to Florida and I knew my parents would be talking politics the whole trip down so I bought some to cancel out the noice so I did not have to listen to anything. I don’t really use them that much only when I’m in the car.
"Pros for having wired
- no need for charging
- no need to connect it
- other people can't connect to your pair of headphones from another house blaring random audio"
"I miss cords. I had to specifically look for a new phone with a 3.5mm Audio Jack. The jack itself is busted, lasting far less than the five years my old one had, which still works. Have to get an absolutely awful Bluetooth earbuds."
Imagine people come at you from both directions and take an airpod.  Who do you even go after?
"i think deodorant/anti perspirant would be an excellent one, household cleaners, a lot of that stuff seems to correlate with cancer rates and other diseases. putting silver compounds on your lymph nodes just doesnt seem like the best idea"
I used to prefer wired buds also. I tend to drop my phone and those weak ass wires holding the buds together are constantly breaking. I end up buying cheap $20 wireless buds from a gas station. I do lose one bud of 2 quite often but it's a cheap replacement. I haven't found a good product that's strong enough for my phone dropping yet...
"Samsung stuck with the 3.5mm jack until the s20. Having a 3.5mm jack was one of my arguing points for sticking with Samsung/Android. Here I am with a s20 Ultra and a dongle... ugh.

Having that said, buying this phone made me buy Galaxy Buds and I haven't looked back at wired headphones since."
"Apple is a great company to popularize something useful and then allow competitors to actually make it good.
If suckers who actually use apple products want to sponsor this relationship, then by all means I hope they do!"
"Listening to this on AirPods rn, meta af"
Apple is like one of those get-rich-quick gurus online. They hide their own money making ambition by making the lesser minded believe they do it for them
"Calling it a ""cultference"" is pretty spot-on for Apple"
I'm also sticking with wired headphones. They are way more reliable and better than air pods. Wired  headphones are Best
"Those magic anti-people barriers fail to ward off speeding ambulances that need my ass out of the road, or bosses that need my attention. I love BT headphones, but bands/wires/etc that allow them to be pulled off are necessary."
I just discovered you the other day and have already watched the majority of your videos. You deserve all of the views and subscribers.
"on my 1st nite w/ pixel buds one fell into  and I didn't realize it for over an hour -- dried it, cleaned it, and it still works to this day. oh, and Find My Device works like a charm w/ them"
Just get the ones connected to each other bud by wire. That can hang on the neck.
Say what you will but Tschaikowsky was a genius of a compoers. Your use of its material is beautiful.
"""Fuck yeah! They're so brave, they're basically Mother Theresa!"""
"I bought a set on amazon which costed me £40, they're not made by apple though compared to my sons airpods the battery lasted a bit longer between charges and the sound quality was just as good. I just refuse to pay apples ridiculous prices when my money can go toward things I really need like food and toilet paper."
"Dude, I love your channel. Recently found it and have been binge-watching :P"
"I've had the AirPods Pro, they're nice. Sold them after I lost my job.

I'll stick to my WH-1000XM3.
Def. getting the WF-1000XM4 and the WH-1000XM4 , but may want to sell my WH-1000XM3 first."
"Ah... well the thing with wired headphones is... I've had 3 wires become non-functional due to being jostled around too much when I move, in a time span of 5 years. The total price of these combined headphones was 160€. I'm fairly happy with wireless, because it also means I can set my phone down on a counter and move around in the kitchen without having to worry about cable snagging or taking my phone with me everywhere."
I'm over here rockin my wire headphones. Screw trends lol
I can’t lie since I first went wireless when my brother gave me a pair I have never gone back. First it was cheap wireless then soundcore airs which are meh. But the AirPod pro is just the standard that can’t be beat
I like to fall asleep listening to ASMR or meditation content and I would always wake up  with my earphones all tangled around me or I’d damage them in my sleep—so I really like my AirPods. They provide me what I’m after in that way. ️️
"I love my AirPod pros, yeah charging them suck but the noise cancelling, the general apple magic of them syncing will all my shit automatically, and the freedom of wireless earbuds and not yanking the cable and breaking them has made them so much better for me than wired even if I do make compromises on things like sound quality the convenience is key"
Imagine paying 150 for earbuds (enough for a whole phone) or just buy some from aldi. Your move apple
I'm pretty sure Covid was sponsored by Airpods with the amount of them being shown on all of the web-meeting type TV shows on.  Smart move.
I'm happy with my wired ones. Everyone on Reddit agrees with me on that wires equals better sound quality without any Bluetooth comprimation
Stede your ship is driving towards an iceberg! OH NO HE HAS AIRPODS HE CAN'T HEAR US-
"Yeah.
This is why I bought a Sony phone. It lets me use the same pair of earbuds I've had for like 10 years now that works JUST FINE.
And what's so bad about putting distance between us and other humans? I've been using headphones for that since 2003..."
They probably made them so easy to lose intentionally so they would have to keep buying replacement
Been a subscriber since 15k. Glad to see you getting the attention you deserve finally.
"Your channel is awesome, so glad the YouTube algorithm brought it into my life! Would you consider doing a video on... dropshipping, Amazon affiliate marketing orrrrr livestreaming  apps (e.g. Tango or Bigo). They’re murky A.F."
Glad someone has the courage to tell me what I want then fleece me for the piece of  cheap junk
"I have samsung buds + and very pleased with the purchase, I haven't lost them or anything, noise suppression is good, and if I want to talk to someone I just enable the setting that allows me to hear the outside world through the buds. Idk after these I can't go back to regular wires"
Can't wait for Apple to do the same with VR headsets
You missed the part that THEY JUST DONT FUCKEN FIT IN EVERYONE'S EARS
"I think the Bose QC35s may be the best wireless headphones of all time. So comfy, wired option, and excellent noise cancelling. (Audiophiles don't bother responding, they sound great to me and other normal people.)"
The problem with apple it’s that their ecosystem works so well between like all the devices so if you buy a iPhone you will notice that you get many benefits if you have a Apple Watch then you realise that all those 2 works so much better with a iMac or MacBook because they all work together so damn well which no other company does that but I do love apple I have a few products 
You missed that wired headphones actually sound better too 
"I think the sole reason I used them was mainly for the design. It doesn't feel as flashy or gimmicky as its competitors.

That said, the maintenance is garbage. I bought two seperate charging cases before just giving in to Bose's version."
"I broke 4x headphones in a year from biking and wear and tear at the headphone jack.
The headphone jacks sucks and I am so glad to use Bluetooth Ear phones: 
-Great for cooking while placing the device on the table and you can move freely and turn around
-they work with all devices"
"""apple are just continuing the legacy of their freezer-drawered founder"" LMFAOO brutal"
This is a good channel. This and internet Historian are my favorites now
Thank you internet historian for blessing us with this man
THANK YOU OH MY GOD. I AM SCREAMING! I hate AirPods they’re such trouble and everyone just wants to be cool and follow this cult! AHHHHHH! Okay done now :)
How did you not mention the abysmal sound quality they all have? The commercials were such blatant lies I'm a bit weirded out that nobody is pointing it out.
"I guess apple have never heard of the saying:
''there is a fine line between bravery and stupidity''.
They're so past the line they can't even see it anymore."
"""If you like your planets flat and your vaccines THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME"" 
Killed me "
I like being able to play music and also charge my phone without replacing a dubiously dealt double dongle every 2 weeks
"""Their sticker price IS their marketing strategy."" Who has a bunch of megaphones and would like to join me on the rooftops?"
"The only reason I'd gotten myself Sony true wireless earbuds is so that I can wear them without accidentally yanking out the cable, and because they have more longevity"
"I wouldn’t pay for AirPods, but true-wireless earbuds are awesome, especially if they have active noise / noise cancelling functions. If you can afford nicer mid-range ones, I highly recommend them, but even if you’re a broke college student, you’ll get more mileage out of some $30 Skullcandy Jibs than you’ll get out of anything wired in that price range since there’s no cheap wire to snap in half after a month of use. For me, being able to get stuff done around the house without carrying my phone is huge, as is the ability to have multiple devices simultaneously connected to one set of headphones."
Never gotten rid of my wired headphones because I lost a knockoff AirPod whilst taking the ferry to liberty island.
"I use semiwireless earbuds.
The jaybird x3.
Its way more usefull when travelling by bike since now i have physical buttons and a secure cable thats not too long"
"I feel like partly they did it was to increase you phones battery life, indirectly."
Sticking with wires. Such courage!
"I really like wireless headphones, I've never owned airpods but wireless has a few advantages for me. My work is quite phisical and I move around a lot so after a two weeks of use the cable on headphones gives up, also I don't have to have my phone in my pocket where I can crush it when I lift things, also the radiation comin from Bluetooth is much much smaller than if you hold the phone to your head so if you spend a long time talking on the phone I absolutely recommend  wireless o even wired set of headphones"
"Surprised you didn’t talk about the environmental impact. AirPods have a small battery and delicate components that degrade quite fast, and everything is sealed in meaning repairs aren’t possible without breaking them. This essentially means AirPods are a consumable product which has huge implications on the environment. E-waste is already a massive problem and these aren’t helping."
"My wires work, why would I replace them?
""the wires gets caught on door handles all the time"" then pop the wire underneath your shirt.
""they get tangled up"" then untangle them.
""the future is wireless"" by the time that becomes reality, when wires are seen as a ""relic of the past"", all the issues of wireless today will have been ironed out. Until then, I want my music transmitted through a wire and not get lost in the air highways."
I rather enjoyed wired headphones until finding a dongle to use them became a step.
I know this video came out ages ago but I just wanted to say that you can buy a single AirPods separately. I lost one of my AirPod Pros and then I went to the apple store and got one for about 100 dollars.
Okay so did you suddenly get favored by the algorithm?? I've been watching since your cereal video and I was shocked to suddenly notice how your views have TAKEN OFF. Congrats!! You deserve it!
The applecult is particularly interesting to observe as it violently defends and justifies apple's newest idea to squeezed more $$$$ from its mindlessly loyal cashcult.
"I pay $10 for my earphones at Walgreen's. If they break or I lose them it's no big deal because they're only $10. even if I'm using Apple's dongle to attach my earphones, it's still an extra part I have to keep track of and try not to lose and replace if something happens to it."
"I have the Sony headphones in the video, they're fucking amazing. But I made damn sure I got them thru best buy and had the warranty."
"I have the Sony WH1000XM3's and they're baller. I'm not an audiophile but they sound really good to me, they're noise cancelling and wireless but if the battery dies they can go wired. I love em."
"7:01 only 130, must have been a tough year for the wireless markets, you know, underperforming by over 4,500,000%"
"Apple sells single airpods, but for way more than half the price of two"
"so weird sony advertised them like that, cause I own those earbuds and the reason i got them was because they have a mode that lets you HEAR ambient noise without everyone around you hearing your music.which seems perfect for an office? there is no other reason to buy them over anything else, the noise cancelling is the sameeee"
"I don’t know, I’ve had my pods for two years and I’ve never had problems. No Bluetooth disconnecting, no losing only one of them. They aren’t the best option out there by far but they are a quality product"
"The genius of removing a port to save money and then selling an extra adapter for more money to unfuck that cost saving measure is amazing when you hate consumers as much as Apple. 
Or you can pay extra to not have to plug anything into it and the thing you have to pay extra for is extremely easy to lose meaning you would have to pay AGAIN. Nobody should have ever fallen for this. "
"I've tried the 500€ AirPods Max and I own the Sony wh-1000xm3 that cost 230€.

It isn't even a contest. The Sony are so much better by any measure except being a status symbol"
I had the same ones for years and use them everyday and I have ever lost one EVER.
You're like a demented version of Ben Wishaw and I love it.
"Yes, let's give people who stare at their phone while walking the streets noise cancelling ear phones.
  Now they're not looking where they're going and they can't hear oncoming traffic."
"“During this sales period over 130 wireless headphones were sold worldwide”

I mean you’re not wrong..."
"What Apple needs to understand is that removing the headphone jack didn't take courage. Now, releasing the next iPhone, but making it one of those old-school mobile phones that has a keypad, and they don't know if people would like it and embrace the nostalgic design or just completely reject them, that would take actual courage."
"You can buy a replacement airpod for all generations if you lost one, or lost the case."
I find funny that people assumed already apple invented Bluetooth earbuds... As they invented the smartphone and personal computer... lol
Imagine a multimillion dollar company that isn’t morally corrupt in every way just looking to squeeze every last cent out of consumers over some earbuds
"I used to be all about the wire too, thinking ""battery=bad"". BUT where is the highest point of failure on the wired headphones/earphones? That's right, the cable—literally any part between the jack and the ear bit—lost a non-significant number of otherwise very decent earphones to that.
The best of both worlds of convenience and mechanical resiliency due to the lack of the wire and retaining the practicality of not being easily lost or being capable to hang around neck are the single-bit ones,  whether supra-aural/circumaural or neckband ones. I have circumaural for winter, neckband for summer."
"I was expecting this video to do a complete 180 at the end with a ""This video is sponsored by Raycon!""."
I bought my Marshall 4 headphones and regularly using them for around 3 months already. I literally charged them just once since then; the only time I heard “immatunningoutofbattery” noise
"Compared to all your other great videos, this one seems pretty out of touch. No, the audio jack isn't going anywhere, but insisting that it's ""more convenient"" on your phone with a shitty dac/amp combo and therefore no hifi audio excuse for it's existence, is like insisting that the floppy disk is still relevant (like people did when it was removed).
They wouldn't be nearly as widespread and used by both audiophiles, android users and apple users casually, if they weren't actually good."
"In my country, there are stores that sell basically ripoff airpods with a different colour, different case design, etc. It works perfectly fine, and it only costs 17$. 

Apple can kiss my ass in Kurdistan because I got like a 90% discount! Hell, I think it's BETTER!"
"But they're so convenient I personally love them. I might seem like an idiot consumer sheep but if a product adds convenience to my life at not too steep of a price (I purchased my airpods refurbished) then I'm gonan be happy. So easy to use while doing things like cooking or cleaning riding a bike, it's silly to remove the headphone jack but if they hadn't done that and just came out with the airpods I would've found no fault with them"
"I have a lot of issues with memory and losing shit, never lost my wireless headphones. that's what the case is there for."
"""if you got airpods but still a he button, you basically just put some rims on a 1997 Honda""
car community: well... yeah"
"Do a lot of people actually lose their AirPods? Like that’s never happened to me, I feel like if you spend 160$ on headphones, you’re gonna take care of them"
"""And your vaccines THE FUCK AWAY FROM YOU"" Got me good. That was perfect"
"I wear my AirPods for like 18 hours a day. I’ve dropped at least one of them in the toilet before and both of them into the sink and they were fine. I walk about ten miles/day at my job at Amazon and I’ve had them fall out maybe once, which was probably my fault. I also work out six days a week and have never had issues with them falling out. The only time they fall out of my ear is when I’m tossing and turning in my sleep. They’re almost literally a perfect pair of headphones, maybe not for everyone, but they are for me. I know there are better headphones on the market, but these are as good as I could ever really see a pair of headphones needing to be. If they ever break I’ll happily upgrade to the Pros. I’ve more than gotten my money’s worth out of these."
7:01 I can't even conceive of such a large number of headphones being produced and sold.
"I got the cheap knockoff ones, they only cost like $20 an they've lasted me about a year already  who needs Apple lol"
"Worst thing about them is after some time, your battery won’t last more than 5 min. And since it’s apple they intentionally make it nearly impossible to install a new  battery."
"Apple does sell them individually, received a replacement one today  have to go via apple
Support to order them"
"Internet Historian just called.

He said Raycon Man saw this."
"I only got AirPods because my dad got them for me, and they work fine for my purposes: alone and drawing. But I will always prefer headphones for going into the public or on bus rides, as they actually work at listening to stuff quietly in loud public areas"
"The Bose noise cancelling ones are actually really good, and haven't fallen out of my ears yet. They were also like an extra 100 over airpods, but you get what you pay for when going above the mainline pleb gear."
Mine are the only thing I got from my uncle when he passed away in 2019 and they mean a lot to me and I’m so scared I might lose one
Love your channel man. Keep up the great work!!!
2:50 This is hilarious! Apple gets rid of the wire so people just go and buy it themselves! Screw Apple
"""I'll see you in 2021"" This took a little longer than expected to make, I would guess :)"
"I bought some bluetooth headphones since they were the only ones on sale in Boots (didn't want to rove around during a pandemic and I was there for meds). They ARE wired, but to each other. Honestly it's best of both since you don't choke yourself walking past door handles but can hang it around your neck when spoken to, I kind of like them. Only issue is they need charging."
I like the sony's noise cancelling headphones. Actually using them right now.
"""bravely depriving their customers of things they think they want"", like any form of writable media on the iMac G3"
"I thought it was kind of funny watching this episode with a pair of second gen AirPods.. which has been the best quality of life purchase I’ve made since smartphones came out. You have good points, but all-in-all AirPods and similar wireless earpods are pretty great.. as long as you don’t lose them ;) The point about them being annoying to put away was pretty dumb though. I do it on autopilot by now and despite a bit of extra effort I’d trade it with having to deal with tangled headphone cables any day. Seriously. It’s like 5 second I’m your pocket and they’ve magically turned into a monkeys paw knot"
"See it makes sense that the sales numbers would double year on year because every person who bought em had to buy em again after either losing one or the tiny, terrible battery shitting the bed because apparently $100+ tech is disposable now "
The real question is why does he have a huge model of an AirPod?
They do actually sell the pods individually you just have to buy it from an apple store and the app
"What pisses me off the most about the airpod Max? The price. Watch the next Sony xm5 or whatever to be around the same price tag.
Literally mega rich coorporation shows other  mega rich corporations how dumb their consumers really are. The apple effect"
"Cangrats on the quick growth, you deserve it!"
"If the air pods weren't the standard for earpods sound quality i would 100% agree with you. Of course for the price you could buy a hd600 and a deck for $600 and blow the airpods out of existenc, but again it's not that's Apple it's because the airpods are the best among its counterparts.
Pretty good video nonetheless."
I've had a pair of wireless earphones for a couiple of years now. They cost 30 quid.
"Never thought of getting some of these but dude, you open my ears, i need them NOW"
"Listening to this through my AirPods like:

“Yup, totally true (sips tea)”"
"OT: AirPods are a crime against humanity
Also OT: Buys airpods"
"“30 year technology” Bluetooth 5 JUST came out with the airpods and it took a minute for other “True Wireless” headphones to catch up. We’ve had bluetooth headphones for a while. From only like 2012 to 2017 were bluetooth headphones actually good quality, and they still needed a wire between them because sending a simultaneous signal to both didnt really work yet. "
There are some wireless earphones that have a cord connecting them together so if they fall out it just hangs on you neck
1:08 but..I have corded headphones with an end that naturally fits into my iPhone with no “dongle” and as far as I know were always available post jack-removal
Wireless Earphones are amazing tech though
"Here I am, living like a caveman, never having owned an Apple product."
"Imagine buying Apple products 

Can't relate lmao"
"I have never thought about buying anything from Apple because performance wise I can get anything cheaper for that price and as well, if not better performing. What really surprised me about airpods was that when I was still using bus, I noticed that whenever someone is listening something on airpods, I could hear everything they are listening to, and I think that's a one of the things that I definitely wouldn't like especially for that price"
"This video came out a while ago but maybe you'll see this somehow: you should do an episode on Popcorn. I told a friend of mine that it's my favorite snack, and he commented that it must be something that many Americans from all walks of live and over many years have in common (I'm guessing it's not just a popular thing in the US of course). I'd be interested in learning more about it. I know an early form of it is popped maize which was eaten by Native Americans where they would hold an ear of maze over a fire and the kernels would pop. There may be an interesting history there. In particular I'd like to know why it's so closely associated with movie theaters."
Personally I’m so sick of working in a restaurant with cooks wearing AirPods
Binging your channel gets me through my 12 hour shifts
"10 years ago, I took using Apple products as a symbol of status & higher taste.
Since iPhone 7 came out, I changed. Now I take finding a better product that's also cheaper than Apple as a symbol of status & taste."
"For a channel called ordinary things, this channel is in-ordinarily good for this site."
Literally the only reason I own bluetooth earbuds is because with masks now in our lives I can easily hide wireless earbuds in my ears to make working at my job more tolerable
"Once a video from this channel got recommended to you, there's no going back."
yayyy a new actually interesting and actually funny YouTuber for me to binge watch till I forget to feed myself and almost starve!! Keep up the big funne educational :)
I have beats flex which are both sound dispensers (which is what I’m calling them) are connected by one wire  but still require charge and last half a day which is pretty cool prefer this over wired. Or wireless headphones just one wire for me
I've never found earbuds that could stay I  my hear. The only pair I own have hooks and even then they pop out .
"I freestyle ski, and alot of my friends wear airpods while they ride. I can't tell you the number of times that someone has fallen on a jump and their airpod has come out and gotten lost, in the snow... which is the same color as airpods"
"I find that I tend to use things that I resent needing, like technology."
"Wired is much better in my opinion, and Apple headphones either way are poor quality given the price.  You're buying the brand, not a good product."
I can’t stop watching your videos it’s literally been the only thing I’ve been watching a week straight... is that bad?
"Don't forget that bluetooth has glaring security problems, easily allowing anyone full access to your phone through it.
One of the reasons I use wires is that I can listen to music without having to turn bluetooth on & risk my privacy."
"I worked for Apple and I can guarantee that you can get a new AirPod when you lose or break one. If anyone makes you get a whole new set, you got scammed."
Listened to this through a pair of old over-ear Sony headphones held together by the salvaged remains of the wire from a wire-spined notebook with a fork jammed against the back of the left speaker to keep it pressed against my ear.
"I live in a small town, I didn't use the internet much in 2018, I saw someone in my town wearing a pair, the guy shook his head one headphone fell out and a car drove over it. I though this guy had some wierd earrings."
Apple - Make your products so unbearably simple that they could be one of your customers
I remember being so pissed about the dongle cause it meant I had to choose between charging my phone and listening To my music
"Personally I love my AirPods and Pros. The Pros are hands down the best pair of mediocre headphones you can buy. Do I prefer to use wired cans at home? Yea, totally. But I don’t want to take out an amp and DAC to connect up to my portable music player so I can run my fancy shit on the bus. I’m super happy with Apple Music’s lossless and pro’s out and about."
"I recently got an Iphone 7 and was pretty upset when I could no longer listen to music on my runs because I refuse to cough up the zillion dollars it costs for a product I KNOW I will lose in a week. 
Come on, Apple. Not impressed. :("
The fact that they assumed everyone didn't mind spending £50-£70 on wireless earphones was just fucked imo.
Got one as a birthday gift few years ago and still using it 
"Wireless sucks. More expensive and less reliable technology that you can only use for a few hours at a time and the batteries get worse over time, so you have to replace them, assuming if the manufacturer has given you their blessing and provided you with the privilege of a replacable battery."
7:07 over 130 wireless headphones sold? That's insane
"The courage to remove the headphone jack.

*Laughs in Android*"
"Now that I've watched every video, I don't know what to do with my ordinary life"
"AirPods seem cool and all but my Beats earbuds that I got as a gift a year ago still work perfectly fine and I use them pretty often so it all comes down to durability and quality, along with price of course"
Listening on bluetooth headphones.  100hr battery life and a 3.5mm port for using a cable if you need/want it.  And they were cheap.  Best of both worlds and works with all of my devices.
"3:50 if you have a literal degree in computing science, you can understand it.
plot twist: I prefer analog things, analog tube amp with my guitar, my analog old manual transmission gasoline car, none of those have computers crashing on me"
"8:05 but you can double tap one to pause and double tap the other to use Siri to make a call or answer a call, you don’t have to take them out"
"For calling AirPods a crime, there wasn’t anything in the video that could’ve gone in on that. Was looking forward to hearing something I didn’t already know."
"The RedMagic Gaming phone has a fan, good size, a charging port, touch triggers, and most importantly A HEADPHONE JACK"
I‘ll say one thing: wired earbuds fall out of our head more easily because they’re dragged down.
"Apple made a new version of the shuffle which relied on the headphones to change the song or turn it on for that matter. Then promptly discontinued the headphones, still sits in my drawer completely unusable.

Screw apple."
I started liking every one of these videos 2 seconds in because I know at some point I'm going to be spitting out my drink laughing
I am happy with my 2009 iPod earphones.
"I wonder if the experience of quarantine will lead people to question the hyper-individualistic nature of modern consumer culture and see the value of community and belonging to a greater whole, even if just for a moment."
XD this is the best video I've seen I've never laughed so hard on a video XD keep up the good work buddy :D
I got a pair of basic air pods 2 years ago after i destroyed 3 wired pairs while skateboarding. I would land and slide on the wire which would destroy it. They actually stay in my head really well I’m glad I got them
"There are people trying to persuade you that removing the headphone jack was the right way to go and many people were ok with it.
Then you look up at the whole DrillGate for iPhone 7 in 2016, people drilling into their phone to get to the supposed hidden headphone jack. "
"gotta say, your vids are 10/10 and I’m so glad to have subscribed"
You know what was really good about headphones of yore? They didn’t need charging.
"Ever since I saw you on the internet historian sundance rejects, I knew you looked familiar, but couldn't put my finger on who you reminded me of, but now I realized, you look like my dealer, only 10 or 15 years younger lol"
"I don't believe there was a correlation between the huge sales number of Airpod's and the theory of Apple themselves pushing Airpod memes on social media. I really don't think they did that and I know you likely said it as a joke (hence the foil hat). I can tell you dislike Airpods, but the product itself is quite genius whether you like it or not.:)"
"1:14 ""They're basically mother Theresa"".. well with her actual history this might be a good comparison"
"The arguments are fair, but I like being able to to walk around while listening to something without brining my phone with, and I absolutely hate it when my wires get caught on something and rip out of ears, so… AirPods for me"
I don't think you need to do the gimmicky stuff like hitting yourself in the head with the giant air pod and saying owe. Great video
"Removing the aux port is just pure dictatorship. Even with an aux port, you can still use BT headphones. Its seriously the dumbest thinking ever."
"I bought a pair of Audio-Technica headphones a couple years ago after wearing through countless pairs of earbuds. I hate planned obsolescence with a burning passion and I'm never going back to earbuds, wireless or otherwise. If the chord or the ear pads get worn out, I can just replace them instead of throwing the whole thing out."
Who cares about the removal of headphone jacks? You can make your own jack with a power drill and like 2 minutes of effort.
“I dont really give a shit wether my music has traveled through air or not”
"Get some cheap ones from wish, they are actually pretty good as long as you get used to the quirks and but those that doesn't bend in any way so you can use them in the same ear and only use one, you know so you can be aware of stuff around you somewhat."
"I got some of the sony wireless earphones, they are connected to each other with a control unit on one side and the battery on the other so you can just take them out as they hang on your neck. Battery is long, sound is okay (got what I paid for £25) and they have been ideal for cycling and snowboarding as I don't have pockets in good places and I have a phone that is an odd size. The Moto G50 randomly is the same width as your average phone but slightly taller so that when I watch videos I get black bars at the side as one supports this dumb screen size. Again got what I paid for though."
"My ear buds always fall out my ears, so no way I’m swapping to wireless, wired is no problem for me"
"I have owned the Sony WF-1000XM3 for a year and a half almost and they are my favorite pair of headphones ever. The audio quality is the greatest I’ve ever heard, the noise canceling actually works. I mostly use them to go to the gym, the noise canceling is great for blocking out crappy gym music and the clunking of weights in the background, they are great products which sadly got overlooked by the AirPod trend. If you want truly wireless earbuds go with Sony honestly, unless you just want aesthetic and not quality"
AirPods will never be 1/100th as incredible as riding mowers 
Currently listening to this with AirPods. The irony.
"Your channel is growing so much, the first time you got recommended for me you were like 90k subs"
"I tried air pods and Samsung's galaxy buds; and imo, the galaxy buds are so much better. better noise isolation, can't fall out of your ears easily, and adjust the base and etc. I got my galaxy buds for 100 dollars on black friday (what a steal)"
Apple sure did go in a downward spiral with that idea.
"Surprisingly, for so many complaints about the AirPods not fitting in well or falling out constantly or not delivering the very best sound, they fit perfectly snug in my ears so they deliver some of the best sound I’ve heard.

Lucky me I guess!"
My wireless earbuds died right as he started talking about battery life lmao
"“During this period over 130 wireless headphones were sold worldwide,” I mean technically correct lul"
3:35 should they completely remake Bluetooth just because it's old? it literally works anyways.
Apple: Fashion through a facade of technology.
"Honestly love my airpods and wireless is the future lol.
Wires are great, but for mobile technology wireless has so many advantages.
Not having space for the headphone jack means bigger batteries, storage, cooling for the apu, etc.
People complain about the “premium” of apple products, but they keep their resell value... by a good amount compared to the competition."
You should really make a video about the embarrassment of Adobe’s entire CC 
"I remember how dumb I thought Apple Watches and AirPods were. Now I have both. They were both hand me downs but still, yikes lol"
"Ive lost 3 different pairs of wireless buds now, their cases included and I can say I'll be using something with a cord going forward cause everytime I take one out to talk or listen to something I shove em in my hoodie or pockets or they fucking drop and I lose them 24/7"
"I decided to get cheap enough ones, for €30 I got some decent Tronsmart ones during a sale on Amazon - it's shape means the whole fumbling thing is mostly gone

Jesus I sound like a bot"
You didn't even mention that they fry your brain - specifically pineal gland - by communicating from one to the other through your brain. -Fellow tinfoil hat wearer
"Hey, fun fact: Bluetooth audio is compressed.

This means that wired headphones are a clearer signal than Bluetooth, along with the other things you said."
"I've never enjoyed earbuds, so airpods certainly aren't my thing. Not only do they hurt my ears, but they constantly seem to get loose and never stay put. I much prefer the comfy insulation of my beats headphones."
"I was given, against my will, an iPhone 11 for work. It took me a month before I stopped bringing headphones to work, because I kept forgetting it didn’t have a headphone jack. Stupid af."
I use wireless earphones at work because my hair hides them and I can listen to podcasts and music when im not supposed to.
"A person actually said i was ""too poor"" when i said that i bought a pair of Sennheiser M3s instead of a pair of Apple Beats"
man if they were really about courage the lighting port would be USB c
"As someone that got AirPod pros for free, I barely use them. The $15 pair I got from Amazon don’t have the same bass but overall have much better sound quality"
"I work in retail. Every time someone comes up to the till and has AirPods in their ears. My first thought is “can you take those out for two fucking seconds to be respectful?”
My second thought is “oh boy, I’m going to love seeing how you react negatively  to the price of your groceries when you’ve clearly got the money for $250 wired earbuds without the wire."
"Apple: here's a 500 wire, and yes we know we just invented then uninvented the wireless headphone.   You're welcome."
"Personally i just buy a pair of $10 over-ear headphones.
They last longer then the in ear kind and are way more comfortable."
"""Flexing"" is what sells things like this . Airpods are considered a ""luxury item"" just like hoverboards and Yeezy's and lots of things like that. People feel good having micro status symbols and whatnot"
"I'm gonna be skullcandy's lone customer, refusing to move to Bluetooth headphones"
"So getting rid of the headphone jack was clear as day just a ploy for more money. There’s literally no pros to getting rid of the 3 mm jack. And there’s lots of cons. But that’s a whole separate issue. I actually bought some air pods and I loved them. I dropped them a bunch and they stopped working but that’s on me. I never had a problem with the battery life, I just charged then every night and they lasted a long time. I never lost one because I keep track of them, and they can fit in my pocket easily. and I LOVED the convenience of being able to take them out and put them away, and vice versa, in like 5 seconds. I could not do that with normal ear buds. They actually solved a lot of small problems in that regard. But here’s the catch, I bought Chinese clones. Identical in every way, even said “designed by apple in California”. I did lots of research (this was probably a year after the apple air pods came out) and found the ones that were most similar to apple ones, at a competitive price. $40. At this price point it was an easy buy and I never regretted it. I will probably buy another brand of wireless earbuds next because I have absolutely no doubt other companies can do it better than apple."
"Good to know, after buying some two days ago lol"
“We don’t think this is what’s part of a great product so we’ll leave it out” until next year when we release a new phone
"while traveling, bluetooth headphones are more comfortable to use compared to wired though"
That toilet thing happened to me too lmao
Also the frequencies produced by a lot of modern day devices have potential links to increasing the chance of getting cancer.. so there's that as well that you'll be putting on whilst wearing your slightly more convenient ear toothbrush heads
"""Apple is so expensive!""
Then just buy something else, anything else?"
"Me, who got AirPod pros for Christmas seeing this is my reccs: "
i use wireless headphones but another thing about rechargeable batteries is they can only be charged so many times and as they age the charge they can hold keeps going down. they’ll last a little while but you either have to replace the battery or the whole thing before too long. convenient to not have wires but it creates unnecessary e-waste
"The wireless headphones/earbuds I got cost about 25 USD, have surprisingly good sound quality/bass, stick in my ears completely and last a long time. I bought them because I have caught/broke the wires on fences/posts etc multiple times while skating, and I actually broke a pair inside my phone and now the jack is fucked and doesn't work. (these ones have the squishy ear pieces so they fit snugly in). Airpods fall out though, if only when moving fast"
Laughs in $50 cheaper JLab earbuds that have batteries that last double the time
"Damn, your videos are something else, especially the quality"
"Whenever you think Airpods Max are expensive, go look up what wired audiophile headphones can run you."
airpods are for the people who cant afford the wire
I have a pair of those Sony headphones and I must say they are awesome.
The moment apple releases glasses I'm gonna start believing the guy with foil on his head.
"As someone who will never go back to wired headphones/ear buds again, because I genuinely find dealing with wires annoying as fuck... I still think phones should include a headphone jack, as an option, especially because you have to go pretty expensive to get good earbuds vs wired earbuds which are cheap. Also the headphone jack works as a radio antenna which I didn't learn until this month and it's so cool but idk if I will ever use the feature lmao"
"personally if you never go for the top of the line product u can still get some good stuff for a decent price, like the iphone SE"
i love my airpods pro .. lol. wireless is the future.. and by the way .. airpods correct over airplay on an iphone which can use your wifi or bluetooth depending on circumstances
"Coworker: ""you don't know how much i spend on apple?""
Me: laughs in warhammer"
Can’t get enough of your videos. Binging for like 12th time
"""untangling your sound snakes"" is going to be the new vernacular of 2021"
"I like wireless headphones, because the cable really is kind of a pain. For example, I enjoy snowboarding and mountain biking. Traditionally, I've used cable headphones to listen to music while doing those and the wire would constantly get hooked and pulled out. Now I just wear some cheap wireless earbuds and the problem is solved."
"I totally agree with your opinions on AirPods specifically, but Walmart's Onn brand recently released their own airpod clone... for $12/pair... and they're actually fantastic. 
Lost an airboy? 
PFF no biggie, go get two more for $12! "
You have no idea how many times I accidentally hit the cords of my earbuds and they flew out my ears
this is probably a bad time to say that you can get them individually as part of a repair...
"I only use Bluetooth headphones when I'm active, where wires will keep getting snaged. Otherwise I just use wired earbuds."
5:23 when the pretender is acting suspicious in a way that is mistrustful.
07:02 'during this sales period over 130 wireless headphones were sold worldwide' That's not a very impressive figure
"I like to use wireless  earbuds while running, the wires tend to annoy me. Have never bought any Apple products, though."
I just like the fact that I can have wireless earbuds at half battery and when it dies I go to sleep
"I rewatch your channel quite frequently. It’s just class A, pure China white excellence"
Goddamn I'm waiting for a brain implant which would act as an invisible headphones for us.
im not even joking i literally just forgot where i set my airpods case
"I needed this vid so much.

I actually think that AirPods and wireless headphones in general are a great product. What I fcking hate is when you get on the subway (remember) or go around a university library and every.single.person. has these hanging from their ears. Like why would you do that?"
Was expecting at least a mention of potential dangers of sticking Bluetooth signals in your ears all day
"My parents got me knock off ""pro buds"" for Christmas. Not bad, but I think I'll keep using my wired headphones."
"Apple entirely knows what they are doing.  They're a fashion company, not a tech company.  They have the founder, who they raise to mythical status, the repackaging of basic features other cheaper tech had for ages are new innovation, etc."
"I use wireless cause I broke a headphone in the jack, and i cbf replacing the phone yet.  but otherwise, big fan of good quality, wired headphones.  big wireless one piece headphones are back where we started lol"
"Courage? Yeah I'D call that ""showing the experts that people will buy our shit blindly without thinking"""
"I have a pair of Anker earpods. They cost like €50 and sound the same as Apple's stuff. I've tried both, couldn't tell the difference..."
"For me the fidelity is keeping me away from wireless buds, even the ""pro"" model have awful highs and feels overly V shaped. No to talk about the shitty connectivity that crackles and pops sometimes, completely ruining my immersion."
"I just have Sennheiser bluetooth headphones and it's perfect... I no longer jank the headphones/earbuds off my head because the cord gets stuck on something, and those headphones are way to big to get lost ."
"""core theme of the event"" 
""cult-ference"" 
Glorious. 
Marvellous. "
"Wires also lead to higher quality audio, especially microphones."
The issue is wired  headphones are made extremely inferior compared to old headphones. I can take twenty year old headphones that don't work and splice the wire and they work again. New ones get pulled a little tiny bit and break can't be repaired.
"i have 2 pairs of airpods and 1 charges fine every time but the other pair sometimes makes 1 airpod not charge, they've already died once but i got a free replacement"
I can't stop staring at the spot under his right eye.
Okay but the only reason I can listen to this while at work is because of wireless AirPods
"Honestly just buy wired off-brand earbuds. I recommend heyday, they work amazing and they're only like $10 a piece."
Tbh i got bluetooth headphones because my cables constantly broke which made cable headphones more expensive in the long run
"I do prefer Wireless headphones when I go for a run. (headphones not earbuds) Because they're wireless, I don't have to worry about them getting tangled up, caught on something, or just falling out. I want to be in that focused Zen-mode when exercising, so not taking them off and not talking to people are kinda the point, lol."
They have a dip in the speaker perfect for collecting ear wax
"Personally, while I’m not typically prone to conspiratorial thinking, I’ve always thought that the push toward wireless headphones and airpods were just a ploy to get more people to keep Bluetooth on so they could collect more personal data related to Bluetooth

The only other major thing I think of that way is Facebook saying that taping over your webcam is bad for the webcam, like they’re definitely trying to squeeze more data out of us that way and cover for it lol"
"You can buy individual airpods, you need to call the technical support team and they send you a replacement for the cost of one airpod"
"I like having wireless headphones for the gym etc, but will only get ones that are attached by a wire to each other, so I can hang them around my neck and can't lose just one!"
"I have always hate cables in my headphones, mi Xiomi airpods are cool "
"So does it mean I win since my head over ear headphones are bluetooth, but also have a headphone jack for wired operation if needed on them which I can use anytime?"
7:00 “over 130 wireless headphones were sold and over HALF of those were AirPods” ..... so like 70 AirPods sold? Wtf
They literally do sell them individually. It’s $79 for a replacement pod.
"Honestly, they feel like budget versions of those ""gamer"" bluetooth headphones but way smaller and even more expensive. Like c'mon man, no one wants to pay for expensive ear pods with no wires that have no use other than be small loose headphones"
“One word... Mon-I mean courage.”
Listening to this on my Raycon earbuds adds an extra layer of irony to this video.
You must spend a hell of a lot of money on all the tinfoil you make hats out of. respect
"apple does sell them individually, they’re 70$"
"Hybrid is the way to go.
Wireless for when you want greater mobility, during work, play, and any time having a wire and/or your phone on you is not desired.
Wired for when you don't want to worry about battery, such as when you are at home relaxing, or in the car driving, etc."
Loved listening to this using my airpods
"i don’t know who that guy is with the tinfoil hat, but he is very smart"
Its great that he has a whole green screen set up only so he can replace it with a blue screen
this guy deserves way more views/subs
Me being someone who looses shit all the time . I only lost my AirPod once when it fell into 3 foot of fresh snow and it was gone forever but that was my fault lol.. and they do sell single ones I’m almost positive . I fucking love them now I was upset about the joke headphone jack but if I need to use my over ear headphones I just plug them in and leave the adapter on them at home
My sister got me a pair of JBL noise canceling wireless headphones this Christmas for under $40 on sale. Why in the hell would somebody spend $549 on apples headphones or whatever it is that beats go for now? Because of covid I've not really worn these out of the house and I have to admit I haven't used them as much since the Christmas holiday when I was watching my TV while listening to it on my headphones but I'm hoping post covid to use them during bus trips or hikes. Anyway that's not the important part the important part is that I got a really good pair for less than 10% of the cost of Apple's bullshit flex phones.
"Decent quality headphones : 15 €
Well, I think my argument is over"
"AirPods: Crimes Against the head
Watching this video after 10 minutes: Crimes Against Youtube"
You better be working on the next video. I binge watched all the content of your channel and demand for more
"I love when people bring up that AirPods don’t have a replaceable battery, as if any of the true wireless headphones have replaceable batteries. It’s almost as if you’re going to make a product that’s smaller than the size of a finger with technology crammed into it, you can’t afford to make a tiny little mechanism  can replace the tiny the little battery in it. People like AirPods because they work well with their Apple devices and they’re incredibly light. You’re not going to be able to get that with a user replaceable battery that uses a standard off the shelf battery."
Tip for finding AirPods: play a song at max volume and listen for it.
Thinking about getting airpod pros off of ebay and then cleaning them so I can get a pair for like 40 quid
"All my ""down with capitalism!"" friends are Apple fanboys."
No they removed the wires so we’d either buy the AirPods or the earbuds with the lightning jack because the mindless apple minions will buy the phone even if they removed the friggin screen
I want to know how much time per script Ordinary Things spends on making quippy metaphors XD <3
Glad I've never owned a pair of Airpods. Wired headphones rock.
"I find it funny how every single person i know who owns apple products have nothing but praise for it, even people i know who don’t own apple products but have tried it say how great they are. yet these comment sections have such knowledgeable people who can form a strong opinion on it without ever even using it."
"Apple does sell individual AirPods. For exactly a 3rd of the price, surprisingly fair."
Apple just wanted to trademark a name. THEY'RE EARBUDS!
My airpod pros are one of the best purchases I’ve ever made
"Me in 2016 - screw apple. This is stupid. 
2021 - my AirPods Pro are amazing and I longer WANT TO use wired headphones"
Airpods lowkey remind me of that doctor who episode with the cybermen no cap
"I quite rarely take the bus from uptown to downtown, normally just due to weather, its a 15 min walk otherwise.
But at least half a dozen times there's been someone asking the driver if they found their lost earpod....
I just dont how someone could buy into such an obviously flawed product...
Only benefit i could see is my cat wont be able to chew the wires, earbuds are her favorite toy unfortunately..."
"I already hate any headphones that aren't over-ear, I would've forgotten they exist if I didn't see people wearing rhem everywhere"
"I found a proper middle ground in neck band earphones ..they are cool, they don't cost a fortune, I can remove them to listen what people are saying and they  will hang from my neck and will not fall....neat"
I prefer regular headphones because they are easier & more comfortable to wear
I bought cheap bluetooth earbuds solely so I can listen to music whilst at work even though I know full well I am not allowed to do so. :) (My hair is just long enough to cover my ears)
"If you lose one AirPod, you actually can get just one replaced. Just in case anyone didn’t know that"
I don't have airpods but I do have good quality wireless buds and honestly they are great. battery life of wireless headphones is great now and if I need to hear I can just tap one of my earbuds to turn on ambient noise pass thru which pipes in the sound around me. I used to be very against the movement away from wired earbuds but I honestly think apple was right.
This reminds me a lot of Futurama's EyePhone bit of tech on you at all times.
"AirPods Pro for my job have been freaking amazing 
Even at 250"
"As a musician, i stopped using new iphones cuz i need the aux cable to connect to analog mixers. 
Physical media/analog media, cannot be replaced by digital media. 
The same goes the other way round, there are so much benefits to technology too. "
3:10 would've been hilarious if you dropped the huge Airpod in there
"I just use wireless earpods for doing sport.


Not airpods though."
"I've just finished binge watching all your videos. You don't have another channel, do you?"
Capitalist literally believe that having their engineers make minor upgrades and changes to a commodity is a virtue.
"As a software engineer, I feed on your confusion :)"
This man's so dedicated to this that he's crying
"I always hated airpods, until I got them. My sound snakes always get in my way."
"Im surprised nobody has reacted to this channel, i mean, its fking amazing"
I’ll never forget the first time I used AirPods those shits be magical
You also didn’t mention that AirPods have sub par audio quality for the price.
I'm actually grateful for people who buy air pods and new iPhones every year. Because them giving money to Apple enabled them to created new MacBook Air which is quite affordable.
Sony sells buds with a band for 20 bucks and they're actually very decent quality for 20 dollars.
I get my wires caught on anything and everything. Got the bose noise canceling headphones tho. Like over the ear headphones.
"I don't have airpods, but last year I caved and bought some raycons since they're cheaper. Tbh I can't imagine exercising without them. My phone is always falling out of my pocket and making my 7$ gym shorts fall every time I jump so I set my phone aside, I can't even remember what I did before it. But while doing this I still know if wireless earbuds did not exist I'd be getting along just fine without them, wireless headphones are just the simplest and most expensive way to solve my problems."
"Everyone: why did you create airpods
Apple: money"
"At least under Steve Jobs they added features and innovated when they were calling themselves brave. 

Modern apple removes features and calls themselves brave."
"When I meet somone new, I always ask them a question to decide if I want them to be in my life or not. That question is: Do you use apple products?"
"All good points but I had to use wired headphones the other day and within 30 minutes I’d had the chord get trapped on a door handle twice and ripping them out of my ears, had the swing of my arms whilst walking pull them out 3 times and I remember exactly why no matter how shit wireless headphones can be none of their faults irritate me as much as the ones with chorded"
"this video changed my look on airpods, i m sticking with my wired ones until they die at least.."
It looks like he is wearing the same kind of wired headphones that I use. I wonder if he bought them in bulk like I did?
"""Cultvention"" You got that right."
Okay but flirting with my girlfriend at work by putting one earbud in her ear is magic
"Hating on Apple always  just comes out as pretentious. Wireless is the way forward for mobile devices. I still use wired studio headphones at the studio or home and they don't have latency like wireless headphones and you can't compare the sound quality, but still wireless is just better for on the go. When it comes to lightning cables, they have totally never failed on me unlike every USB type port I've had. I rather buy apple products and that does not make me a sheeple. I think I would feel like a sheep if I had to buy new devices every couple of years when iPhones and MacBooks last me an easy 5 years."

"Fahrenheit 451 predicted these so accurately it's scary, I actually call air pods seashells now."
"I’m confused because apple does sell them individually, at least in the UK. Lost my left one and bought a single left one."
"I dunno. I work a job that requires a lot of moving around, bending down, picking things up - and airpods are pretty convenient in terms of the cord not dangling down in front of you and getting in the way. I mean, I suppose you could like put the wire through your shirt, but honestly I think that would look dumber than a set of wireless headphones. Also, being able to use Siri to change music easily while working without taking your phone out is also mad convenient."
And here I thought Pioneer was charging a lot for headphones.
"I like the term ""Head Holes"""
"Doesn't anyone own a stereo anymore and you know want to play music through that? You know, big speakers go boom boom. This was the first thing I did when I got a smartphone and Spotify.

"People really have been fooled by Apple and it's odd. They think that they look sophisticated, but really they just look easily swindled by marketing. They like Apple products because of how they think other people perceive them while owning them, and that's all they really care about."
"Easily lost... 
(looking at my co-worker who due to losing parts and full sets has spent over a grand on replacement sets....)
Hahaha, yeah, turns out anyone who supported a company that exists to dumb tech down is a dumb move and huge waste of funds..."
Wireless earbuds... the biggest scam in history.
"any expert on sound can tell you wire sounds better than bluetooth, since this one can't quite transmit the same amount of information, and are quite lacking on the D/A conversion. Also, apple's headphones are not only overpriced, but also aren't really trustworthy, in my opinion. If you want to spend that much you'll be way better of with a pair of Audio Technica or Senheisers."

"I mean the only reason I have these is because I wear them at work and doing retail work, wired earbuds get caught on bloody everything every 5 seconds. They are more a niche item for my very specific problem. XD"
I’ve been using Walmart wireless headphones for over a year that work great for like 14.99  if I lose them I don’t give a shit I’ll buy another. Who’s better than me? Tremendous ya mo mos
Please deliver the next ordinary thing straight to my face.

"""They're basically Mother Teresa"" ha, couldn't agree more."
"You know, different needs for different people. I can't even imagine going back to wired headphones at this point, the freedom you get to move around no matter where your phone is is just too convenient for me

I still use wired headphones but only for proper music listening sessions, for going around and about wireless earbuds are more than enough imo"
"Airpods? Heck no.

This guy is the perfect conspiracy theorist

of course i have the grandfather ath m50x but im not taking those to the gd gym or out for a run"
"Make more, such good videos!"
"I have a theory (as such, take it with a grain of salt and correct me if you want to): Apple wanted to push wireless headphones after buying Beats by Dre as much as possible. However, Beats' wireless appliances didn't work out as well as planned, and Apple had to find a way to recoup the money they've spent, and figured that by removing the headphones jack from the iPhone people would be ""invited"" to buy their wireless earbuds and/or the wired headphones adaptor, thus making back all the money they've spent."
Regular airpods seem like a drag. Im glad I went all out and bought the airpod pros instead.
"I am an Apple user. No, not white knight, the company itself pisses me off. I just like their products and engineering behind them. As an introvert that sometimes struggles with anxieties I personally love ANC function. I actually really do prefer not to be surrounded by people and noise and being able to turn reality a bit quiet and focus on what I need to focus on.. yes, it is convenient."
the real question is why would you use earbuds when you can use headphones?
"Since the day they were announced, I shook my head internally at people who have them... ridiculous"
"the problem with wired is that your clothes can pull on the wires, also they make noises when touching and banging on clothes when you walk, etc."
"You only popped on my recommended a couple of days ago, and honestly I’m hooked!"
Oh man I've seen so many lost left or right airpod signs around my campus during this time lol
"I have used my mother's airpods and thought they were horribly confusing to use and sound quality was worse than the wired El cheapo ones that came with my ipod video/classic. I'll stick with my bose around ear bluetooth headphones for household use and my bose first generation sounds sport with the physical buttons on them when I workout. Thank you anyways, apple."
Apple does sell them separately. $60 each
i wonder how many people are watching this with an iphone with airpods
"I thought you were able to purchase a singular pod. Not at first, but certainly now. Still a really fucking hilarious video, good shit "
Mate you need to do stand up comedy in this kind of format of reporting because your witty banter and puns really make me lol
Is no one gonna ask where he got a GIANT air pod I want it lol
I finally switched over to Galaxy buds pro and I'm kind a mixed. On one hand fuck are they expensive. They're not too much hassle and it's kinda nice to not have wires that get yanked on by seemingly nothing. I was tired of having to buy new ear buds every month because one of them would die for no reason. The battery life on them seems to be dead already so who knows maybe in the long run it's still cheaper to spend $15 on earbuds every month.
They do sell them individually at the apple genius bar
"I use mine in the gym, training, on runs, and when I'm doing house work. I've never had issues with them falling out of my ears, had them die on me, and you can just tap your ear to pause the music if someone wants to talk you don't need to take them out. To each their own, they are probably my favorite piece of tech I've bought since I've first had access to GPS navigation years ago. Such a simple thing, but very life changing. On the opposite end of the spectrum when I used wired ear buds when running, they'd pop out of my ears consistently. Using them when doing any sort of martial arts training was a 100% no go they'd yank out of my ears so often it was pointless, might as well not bother. Airpods are solid, if I didn't have an iPhone I 100% would have went with something cheaper though."
"I LOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAATHE marketing so much, this channel is liable to give me an aneurysm."
He's right about the prices being a little much and that's a valid criticism. He's also right about the anti-consumer stuff apple does to push people to buy them. I don't feel the criticsm of the airpods are very valid. What about the fact the batteries aren't replaceable or that apple tries to prevent people from repairing their products? You can also buy replacements if you lose a single airpod or the case. I can understand losing them if you're a little more careless but I have never misplaced my airpods. I will say that I've never had any issues taking my airpods in and out. I've never had an issue of them falling out or connectivity issues.  I paid for the convenience of no wires and instant connection and that's what I got. I love working out with them too.
"I only replace my iPhone if it breaks, which usually takes around 5 years. I’m still using the first iPad I bought to watch YouTube videos on my bed."
"Doesn't the new one have external mics to solve ""annoying fumbling"" problem. It's almost like they engineered that. Create the problem, sell the solution - at a premium, of course."
Love your videos !!!!!!!! You're so funny and they are so interesting ! Finally realized who you remind me of  -----thomas brodie-sangster!!! XD hahaha and just as cute too!!!!!! KEEP BEING AWESOME WE LOVE YOU <3
"I use a sony necklace style wireless earphones for years now. Narrow, light, no cables, can use it for days with a charge, can rest around my neck when I don’t need it."
"Nearly killed myself when I lost my new AirPods, case and all."
"I mean, Flash is officially dead on January 12th.


Maybe Steve Jobs was right."
"So much courage you’ll be saying “gosh, stop being so courageous!”"
"I'm not going to stick little plastic things in my ears and listen to a 90 minute live Steely Dan concert. That would be stupid. Instead I will wear my inexpensive Sennheiser headphones, or better yet, push air in a room with hifi speakers and sit in a chair- approximating the live concert experience by tenfold compared to those ridiculous wireless bullsh** buds. After dropping that much money on them, did you consider how TINY the batteries must be? Each has a bluetooth RX/TX, processors, amplifiers, to support the drivers. When the battery konks out, you're screwed and the proud owner of two tiny pieces of e-waste. Just use a wire! Your phone doesn't have an audio jack?? You bought the wrong phone."
I have the impression that wires are so uncomfortable as you spend too much time detangling them :/ and if you want to take airpods off out for just a sec you just have to put them in your hand or pockets…
"Thank God, I do not have an apple phone, I do not like to use headphones or airpods or anything that separates me from my environment, I cannot function if I am isolated from sounds around me. I feel sorry for those who got tangled up in modern crazy technology, people become  obsessed by it and they are slaves in this sickening race for the latest version which adds up to the wealth of the companies."
7:04 oh my god?? I had no Idea apple sold over 65 airpods?!
This mans haircut is a crime against the head
ayyy dude you did here we fucking gooooo I'm so happy for you. 1 mil in 2021 for sure
"If I ever get around to making my movie (working title: DARK MAGUS, BENT SCEPTER: THE JOHN DEE STORY), I'd sure like to cast you as the Elizabethan Sage himself.
Are we on?
Regards,"
"I will only ever use wired, over ear, headphones."
"As much as wireless earphone are convenient, I'll stick to wired earphones for awhile . I like my earphones to not die on me in the middle of a long ass trip."
Apple does sell them individually. I’ve bought them for my niece
your hairstyle is a crime against the head. love ur vids tho ️
Wired earphones and headphones are generally better for audio as well.
"8:51 Gee, I wonder why the song being played is called ""Dummy!""?"
"I remember wanting to hate the AirPods, and only bought them on sale for $100 to try out. They’re one of my favorites with my beats solo pro being my top favorite for work, and the AirPods my favorite for home."
Future to the back. Apple making future look like a happy ending of a disney movie lol
Me listening to this on my AirPods
"I have $10 ""fake pods"" (thanks Target value bin) and a set of AirPods (gifted, of course). I actually prefer my ""fake pods"" for working out (louder sound, more noise cancellation, and better fit) and wired headphones for everything else. I can't stand changing the Bluetooth connection (""ah crap, forgot to disconnect it from my phone so I can use them on my computer""), dealing with disconnection at random (Bluetooth tech in general), and charging them for anything longer than an hour (so much for that Netflix movie...)"
"pretty sad man, like the beats maybe they are so overpriced they end up overshadowing better wireless headphones at much better prices. And because Apple always gets away with the shit they do, everybody else just follows suit, aka samsung mocking apple taking headphone jack then the next year they taking it out too."
Apple zombies be like: TheY arE tHe beSt wirEleSs earBuDs iN the WoRld.
I just buy off brand. I love my wireless with a case. Much easier to use in a gym. Don’t get in the way. Don’t need to cary my phone and so on. I won’t but AirPods lmao. I payed $80 for two pairs with charging cases.
holy crap last time i watched you you were at 80k now you're over 300k thats so cool!!
"I wonder if all the ""Android camera bad"" memes were plannned by apple too"
I grew up in Cupertino (that's where apple is headquartered fyi) and couldn't stand that they got to call themselves an American company when all the manufacturing is done overseas
I'm sticking with wired headphones.
"I always wondered what the craze with listening to stuff on-the-go was. I never, or at least, try really hard to avoid listening to music, podcasts, ect. in public because 1.) I think it's kinda rude, 2.) The world is a dangerous place, so I would like to at least hear the danger, and 3.) I like listening to media as an art, not a time passer"
"lol, honestly the only reason apple did that, was so they are able to upsell you AirPods.If you would buy normal headphones... they are $20, tops $50 if you buy very good and fancy ones. That is... compared to $180 not as much money that apple could have made.
4:10 And apple does everything in their power, to tie everyone as good to the apple ecosystem."
How do you make such great content??
Idk man AirPods were probably the best purchase I’ve made in the past year
"ill never fork over my money to apple.  but bluetooth earbuds like the raycons ive had tend to ahve a longer longevity for me than wired earphones sadly.  wired will be lucky to last two months, while my raycons have survived damn near a year with no reduction in quality.  for me its simply more practical to go wireless"
"Never bought those.  Use Anker Soundcore, work well enough."
History is fun because of you.
"If someone is wearing airpods so loudly that they cannot hear regular conversation, they soon won't be needing their ears anyway."
Im proud to say that i have NEVER owned our used anything made by apple...
"There's a two part episode of Doctor Who where The Doctor, Rose and Mickey end up on a parallel Earth where everyone has these ear pods. They were brainwashed, and the tech ended up being used to turn people into Cybermen. Idk felt it was worth reminding everyone that we're in the shit parallel universe."
"From a technical perspective with wire has a better sound quality without any sound delay, next to the reliability."
"I have motorola earbuds and it's just as ""good"" as any other airpod. I don't really use wireless earbuds since i work a lot and i'm not wearing stuff that falls out easily when cycling to work.

Tldr. Just look for normal priced earbuds and avoid anything apple touches because those things cost a whoppong 149 euro's which is more than double what i spent on the motorola earbuds which are 40 euro's or something. If something cheaper is found then obviously buy that and maybe try to find buds that are from the same company your phone comea from if that feels safer."
"I have a pair of Galaxy Buds and they were $70. Came with a charging case. They fit very comfortably and the customizable touch screen buttons on the side of the buds are so nice. I swear to god this isn't an ad (Samsung sponsor me plz). I'm just saying, they're a very nice option if anyone IS looking for some nice, affordable wireless earphones."
"I like my £20/30 (I can’t remember) Bluetooth headphones, they good"
When will He return?
"I don't really know what to think about Apple's audio products. While convenience and comfort are quite important, headphones were designed specifically to reproduce audio the best they can. Often, when a company tries to cash in on a well-refined industry, they end up making an inferior product with more gimmicks. Most people probably don't care as much as I do, however, as I hear things louder and have a greater emotional connection to music as a side-effect of my ADHD."
"Sure there's the losing them, and the battery life, there's even the possibility that those radio waves that close to your brain aren't safe, but as an American, I just don't want to pay that much money for something that someone could quite easily snatch while running past me and I wouldn't even hear them coming thanks to the noise cancellation."
"Good video. Say what you want, but they are the most sold earbuds in the world. Apple knows how to manipulate people. And they are also making good stuff."
I do like using wireless headphones mostly because i like how easy it is to use and that you dont really need to pay attention to the wire.
meanwhile i have a pair of 20 dollar wireless earbuds that have lasted me a year and show no sign of slowing down
"Call me a 33 year old boomer, however I’ll stick to untangling wires whenever I need to."
This video isn't even a week old and ive watched it 4 times already lol
I got myself some 40 dollar Sony bluetooth headphones. They last 48 hours and they're large enough that I can't lose them. And with no cords they don't get caught on things and my cats can't break them.
"i wish iphones had headphone jacks still. but, ive never lost an airpod and even if i did they have a find mode for a reason. and saying they suck because bluetooth has been around for 30 years makes no sense. computers have been around longer... they usually dont suck"
Watch as I put them in during my YouTube binge before I go to sleep tonight.
">that happened to me
Well, it's what you get for paying exorbitant prices for the privilege of using proprietary spyware."
Dankpods/Ordinary Things Collab?
"Airpods makes me depressed, or rather the whole idea of ""it's not cool unless Apple does it"" that seem to permeate through society. Imagine if Samsung (or in this case Sony) had released Airpods. Sure, it would have sold. But in the hundreds of thousands, not in the tens of millions. Because media or people in general just wouldn't care - because it wasn't from Apple. "
"There’s literally only two reasons to ever need wireless headphones, either during workouts, or you work a manual labor job in which you’re the only person there, I.e. a janitor, or just something where you’re working independently but moving constantly, and even then you can get cheap wireless headphones for 50 bucks at Walmart, and when you’re old ones crap out from sweating profusely in them just buy new ones keep that receipt for the new ones and put the old ones in the new box and return it the next day just saying they don’t work, free wireless for life for 50 bucks."
"Ha-ha-ha    Love your stuff..
Keep it coming!!"
"You should collab with LGR, your vids remind me a lot of Tech Tales but with more satire."
5:24 when the Kaiser says you’ll be home for Christmas and it’s Boxing Day 1914 and you are still fighting
"What reeeaaally bothered me is how they freaking fall out of your ears all the goddamn time and you have to press them deeper every 5 minutes which makes them switch songs. Man, I'll be more willing to untangle a 5 m cord"
"7:33 Took you guys long enough to realize. 

""Society? What's a society? All I See are my online hive mind friends"""
"Shit, they’re coming for us, HIDE RAYCON IS HERE"
Dam you're entertaining & educational!
"To be fair, the wires can be annoying in the gym. Somehow you often pull on them and rip out your headphones."
I just put tampons in my ears and let the strings dangle.  Everyone thinks I have an iPhone.
"8:04 thank you for giving me more reason to not buy airpods or wireless buds. As a hijab wearer, it'd be so annoying to take them off and wear them back everytime"
"I might of had iPhones for most of my life, but I refuse to buy airpods. Skullcandy is cheaper and better."
Who’s watching this with airpods in 
OT has Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon in his bookshelf. I knew he was a man of taste!
"Great video, but i think the best bit really was your pronunciation of toilet - Turlet. killed me "
Nothing about normalising having microwave antennas literally millimetres from unprotected grey matter?  Ok...
Just letting everyone know if you bring your case they will replace them for free obviously they don’t tell people unless they directly ask at the apple store but I was surprised when I heard that because it’s apple but it makes sense they probably are only like 20 bucks at the most to make a single AirPod
I’m wearing them rn. Really convinient.
Is anyone wearing AirPods while watching this.
"One thing you didn’t touch at all, is that there is no data on the safety of long term exposure of Bluetooth devices so close to your head.

Your iPhone for example, probably comes with instructions to not keep it touching your skin for long periods of time. Why? Because the radio radiation is known to harm you."
WHAT IS UNDER YOUR RIGHT EYE ITS REALLY BUGGING ME AAAAAAAAAAAAA
"The worst thing about apple headphones, all of them, is that if you are anywhere near someone who's wearing them, you can hear exactly what they're listening to.
Even if you are yourself wearing headphones..."
"Eh, I have a pair of wireless earbuds.  Actually a couple.  Raycons I daily drove for two years and a pair of Sony WF-XB700s I got for $15 clearance.  I use them plenty, because I work in a room that is impervious to wifi and LTE, but local bluetooth manages alright.  I cna leave my phone outside the room, transmitting to my buds.  Also, it's strangely less anxiety inducing to use my phone as a phone with headphones than holding it to my ear.  I have no idea why I have this anxiety."
The best video to watch on my AirPods
Delillo books and a reference to an “airborne toxic event”? 
My best friend sent me here to check you out we are always having theses conversations thanks kendall
I’m not saying anything but I had AirPods are about a year or two now and I have never lost my AirPods. Not the AirPods nor the case.
Excellent video! My favorite part was using 'dummy!' from the undertale soundtrack
Unpopular opinion. I like wireless headphones and never lost one since release day
"Two words we all need (three if you’re a nerd) 
Headphone. Jack."
"Great Video, but a Raycon sponsorship would have been the perfect capper"
Never owned an apple product. Mostly because I liked stealing my music the proper way.
"Removing the headphone jack to make the phone more waterproof is so stupid. I have never once gotten water on my phone, and I have no desire to. However, at least once a week I get frustrated that I can’t charge my phone and use headphones at the same time."
Such a great creator
I don’t mind air pods as they sound ok but a non replaceable battery means you spend so much on something that in 2 years will need to be replaced. I just got the sony ones instead because they have a replaceable battery
Courage to sell our products (for a much higher price)
"""You know no one liked it when i murdered that guy but you know how i did it? Through courage"""
AirPods are impossible to repair. Once the battery loses capacity they’re just more e-waste.
Hi hope everyone has a great day today and tomorrow
"i feel like nobody brings up something way more important then conveniance - airpods can't be plugged in
this means you can't use them with the following:
Stationary Pc
Most portable Consoles"
"Wait.... but it is 2021
Hang on a minute"
I used to think AirPods were dumb but then I got a job stocking shelves and I use my sisters AirPods with one in and listen to podcasts or music it makes it somewhat bearable
"I would have agreed 100% with you not too long ago, but let's face it: your average wired earphones are disposable products. I can't count how many of them I owned broke for the exact same reason (wire broken on the jack plug). I'm well aware of all the limitations that come with wireless, but I'm also fed up with having to get new headphones every year or so. So I switched to wireless, and keep a regular pair just in case."
Listening to this with my AirPods
"Raycon's are way better! More bass fit snug & u can still talk without taking them out. Now everytime i see wired headphones im thinking ""pffft, step ur game up peasants"" lol"
I miss my headphone jack i use a note 10 plus i can see where i would have been and it would have made the phone look symmetrical
* watches on an android * hmm interesting
"I use headphones while I work, so a cord is 100% not an option. Iv tried it, they get ripped out of my ears jarringly and frustratingly every couple minutes. So although they can get lost and stuff, wireless earbuds are amazing and I use them like all the time. I don’t use AirPods tho, too expensive for something that can get lost or broken so easily."
As if I needed another thing to constantly recharge
"I listened to this video with wirered earphones, ironic."
This channel is addicting!
The only big step from my jack wired headphones it is wireless jack and can hang my headphones around my neck. That's it. And it only cost me  £15.
"7st
All I could hear was, ""Raycon good, wires bad"""
Wired headphones are great until one bud gets a loose connection and stops working.
"I got airpods in 2020. I like using them for chores around the house. But I definitely can't take them outside, they'll vanish entirely. Also, they don't like connecting to my PC for very long. Always blipping on and off, so I have to reset them. I still prefer wired earbuds, because they can't be lost, and I have older devices lacking bluetooth. My complaint is they never last more than a few months, as I use them in a very physical workplace. Those fragile copper wires always fail. Frankly, I think it's all a big scam."
8:30 and also I don't think it's a good idea to be constantly irradiating your own brain with microwaves.
I’ve never understood people who buy all the latest Apple products. Everyone I know who bought AirPods did it just to be ‘hip’ and show off their subservience to the company.
FUNFACT-: THAT GIANT AIR POD IS AN ACTUAL SPEAKER
I'm gay.
"Do an episode about mattresses. 

Spring board. 
Water. "
"Pretty stupid and biased video. Owned airpods for 3 years, no problems, incredible usability and ease of use, and no loss."
"the only reason i changed to wireless (note than im android and hate apple with a passion), is because i have very rough uses for headphones, everyday commute and stuff, no matter how much i tucked the wire or tried not to bend the plug, stuff was bound to happen. i would go through cheap 1 dollar headphones in a week or two, and expensive ones in a year tops. Since i got wireless, they were the same price as the expensive headphones i used to get yearly, still on the cheap side for wireless so they werent the greatest, but they have lasted me over 3 years now"
Anker makes the best speakers of any type for the price
Where did you get the big pod from?
I do prefer wireless over wired headphones. However I do not understand why anyone would ever pay 150+ for a pair of ear buds when you can get similar sound quality out of something that costs like 30 bucks like Skull Candy Bluetooth headphones.
I only use AirPods because my devices don’t even have holes for headphone jacks anymore!
First
"You should do an episode on mother Teresa, she was surprisingly wasteful, incompetent, and cruel."
"Airpods are the best! Because of the resulting wireless airpods-trend that now all company follows, regular wired high quality headphones are now cheaper than ever :D"
2021 I'm still wired. All is good.
Apple's business practices ensure I stan PC/Android until the day I die
Listening to this video while wearing AirPods~
"They can keep all their wireless crap :) - I prefer my old fashioned wired things! Hell, I recently wired (as in: installed networking cables and sockets in every room!) my home, because wireless lan is crappy for a gamer like me (not to mention that it often sucks for streaming video, too!)
ps: I don't even have a half-eaten-fruit-phone! I use an LG G4 I bought in 2016 and I'll only replace that if it dies, because frankly: No revolutionary developments on the phone market, frankly everything is still kind of the same, just a bit more processing power etc. :("
""" sound snakes "" just got your self one step closer to a sub. Gona watch a few more vids first but liking what I'm hearin so far. "
I 100% want the wired phones.
"My Aftershocks Aeropex was worth it, never would I get those pods as they're not a great replacement for earbuds"
I got these jlab airpods that rap around your ears with a magnetic slim case and pretty cheap
"i hate how everyone always leaves out one VERY crucial part of the general critique of apple:
products designed to break the moment the warranty is void
""sir we can REDUCE production price by switching to a screen that breaks LESS and is BETTER in every way""
""no."""
In a normal city you can't hang Airpods Max on your neck. Because you'll get mugged.
"I am sticking with actual headphones, the sound is better my ears are warm and they are cool"
"Not too long ago a jogger was running past me.
His expensive iPhone was bouncing up and down, partly out of his back pocket, with every step.
Eventually, it bounced out completely and smashed onto the concrete.
I shouted after him."
Kinda makes me happy Steve bit the dust
I would never buy AirPods because I would lose one of them  about five minutes after I took them off.
It’s a hassle to take them out and put them away? you know you can turn on transparency mode or pause your music or just hold them in your hand right? You don’t have to simply take them out and spend the ten seconds of putting them away if you don’t wanna
The only apple product I bought was sold by software. The app was GarageBand.
Jokes on Apple airpods are the style of earbuds that will not stay in my ears. Thank you genetics.
"Can someone please explain to me why people like Apple earbuds?  I think they're one of the most uncomfortable things ever invented to wear on a human body.  They somehow manage to feel like they're tearing my ear holes open and like they're constantly going to fall out of my head if I cough and yet people constantly rant and rave about them like they aren't basically just the crap, pre-silicone, ""shoving a nickel in your ears"" style earbuds that everyone used to sell in the early 2000's."
Me listening intently... while using my single AirPod
"Honestly my shift is way longer than the lifespan of my wireless headphones. So i end up losing 15 minutes of playtime which yes, isnt much but its 15 minutes i would never loose at all. I’m not getting used to waiting for my music when i know i dont have too"
The fact that there’s an ad for a the AirPods Max directly under this is the cherry on top
Keep your wired headphones they will become retro soon.
You can buy each one separately off the Apple website. Lol $69 a pop
"The Apple logo is just a Supreme sticker
(Don't) Change my mind"
What I hate most about them is others can’t see you’re listening to something so they talk to you. Lol.
"I have AirPods and I’m watching this on Apple wired ear buds, the batteries don’t die"
yo but having wireless music in the gym is a complete game changer
"Honestly the single best thing I’ve ever bought. I am an organized person, never lost them anywhere. The battery is ok and they charge fast. They’re not as good as some big beats for sound quality obv. 
But the chill stress-free wireless experience and the way they automatically connect is everything to me"
I’m on my second pair of AirPod pros (they keep breaking) I’m gonna do apple care one more time and if they break again I’m gonna throw them in the trash and go back to wired or the regular airpods
I just can't do wireless earpieces in general. A decent wired headset can last for years with miniscule upkeep for equal the price.
I'm watching this while listening through AirPods
"I didn’t even want these things, I’m just obligated to use them because they were gifted to me."
"To be fair its so cheap to just buy wireless now, scarbir review site, kenneth tanaka and sean something on here review the brands that come direct from china, when the starting point is around 20 bucks how can wired earbuds compete. At the 22 dollar mark you already have aptx/aac support with something like the gt1 plus, and if you lose them, no big deal, if they run out of batteries, I have a second pair lol"
They are our corporate overlords but I used wired headphones the other day and it sucked so there is that.
"I see so many people wearing these and it's a convenient indicator of who the sheeple are.
Imagine being an executive and being able to spot who you've indoctrinated at a glance. It's dystopian stuff. Or just being some thief must be nice, seeing as those bright white signals in the ear make for a good target. Especially in a big city, and especially during a pandemic, where anyone can wear a mask to hide their identity and not arouse suspicion."
"I never liked Apple products, even as a child. I'd take an 20$ mp3 player over an ipod any day. 
Who in their right mind even wants itunes installed on their PC, rather than drag and dropping your files?"
"The memes were a result of instagram marketing by average joe retailers who were selling Chinese knock-off AirPods to capitalize on the new golden product (cheap + perceived value).  The retailer would pay a large meme page to host their ad, knowing the target audience for both Air Pods and memes was mainly young adults, while others saw only a meme and propagated circulation. So yes, the memes were originally peddled with the specific intent of selling Air Pods, but not by Apple."
EVERYONE THIS IS GREAT CONTENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Wireless headphones exist, so why would you want tiny pieces of plastic that cost more?"
"Galaxy bud lives are best, they rest in your ear and I trust them to not get stuck even though they don't have a huge stick sticking out of there ear. And the case looks great and also it will make a nice sound when dropped."
"i steped into the cult, and high wall garden of apple because I was annoyed at wired earphones, I bought an iPhone to get airpods"
"All of these complaints just sound like personal preference and kind of lame imo. I'm only 3 min in now, but this is already starting to sound like someone who just doesn't like apple products and wants everyone to know. I like the style and structure of your videos and the topics are usually interesting, but this seems less facts based and more ranty. I'll watch the rest and see if you change my mind. You've done it before!"
Good wired earphones actually don't tangle up if you just roll them into a loop and get a case they never get tangled because the cable is slippery
“Cultference”  as I listen to this on my AirPods  I’m brainwashed but I know it and that makes it worse
This channel is just premium Samtime
I don’t get it. AirPods are amazing.
Your channel went online on 22.04.2019 and that's my birthday. It is a nice birthday present you gave me.
It would be courageous of Apple to give Black Friday deals
I though the joke was always on the air poop da doos I had sennheisers I laughed at their beats by dre. It was also really funny because they had no clue and one kids tried to flex. God I hated highschool.
This is a review of the old AirPods then? The Gen 2 and pros are the best wireless earbuds on the market. They also don’t have any of the problems you listed. None.
Bro I lost my right AirPod while I was in a airplane and I’ll never forget that day
"Apple: We fix one problem that didn't exist and created 10 other problems you didn't knew where even possible! 
But look at that sleek design!

My sony headset lasts more than 30 hours on a single charge when used wirelessly, with active noise canceling enabled."
Used to go to the gym and talk to people. Now you have to wave in front of them like an idiot. Thanks Apple.
"AirPods must be very person-to-person with fit. The wired EarPods would get yanked the F out of my head with force due to the wire snagging on things 10x more often than my AirPods fall out when I want them in. /shrug

Man oh man do I fucking HATE when EarPods wires get caught on something and yanked!!"
"It should be noted, you can purchase each AirPod side individually, and the case as well. But only at an Apple Store. I completely agree with everything else you have to say, but you can definitely get overpriced replacement parts. My replacement bud was to be $69 USD, but was still under warranty. They didn't replace my whole set, just the bud I had that was damaged. You can purchase them upon request"
"Man, they are gone from the real world market, cord headphones that is"
Love it so funny
"I thought the airpods max looked pretty cool, but they are definitely overpriced by $200. Considering first gen was $150, the pro were around $230 (but could easily get them for cheaper), pricing these at $500 is steep as fuck. Especially when you can get better headphones for much much cheaper, it’s almost as if Apple is saying “buy our overpriced headphones sheeple, we know you want them”."
"I think the main takeaway is
RAYCON GOOD, WIRES BAD!"
Watching these videos makes me feel    e d u c a t e d 
"yo dude i work for apple, they do sell the airpods individually if you call the hotline and ask for a repair. If it's liquid damage they will charge you for the one airpod they replace."
Cult-ference. Just... That. I cracked.
Love your videos!
The Downward Spiral never ends doesn't it?
Wireless over-ear headphones are so much better.
You a legend man
"AirPods are the BMWs of audio devices. If someone walking cuts you off and they have AirPods in, you'll notice. They come with a sense of ""superiority"" that feels like they think they're better than you, even though this isn't exactly new technology. It's like having an iPhone 12 Pro Max S X R C X Max Pro Pro S 5 +. There are no real benefits over a regular iPhone SE, but it's the sense of entitlement."
Do you have to satirize the fact that big tech wants to push humanity towards a transhumanist dystopia?
"You know what the best part is?
The AirPods sound like shit compared to many 15$ wired headphones."
Yall need some dankpods in your lives.
Apple: crimes against the bank
"I love how they bravely decided I would love to not just keep a pair of headphones in my bag at all times, but have to remember to charge them, and instead of lasting as long as my phone does, they’ll die randomly on me. Also when I’m gardening with my phone in my back pocket and bend over to pull weeds, the Bluetooth disconnects. So convenient thanks apple "
"So so excited to see your channel finally getting the attention it deserves! Great video, as always "
Me watching this video with airpods in my ears.
"I watched this video with my AirPods.
I honestly got the Pros because they work better under my motorcycle helmet than wired headphones or a helmet communicator.  Plus I wear glasses, so I have a place to store them by tucking in between my glasses and my temple."
"they do sell only one piece, and been so for a long time"
I'm just discovering this channel and my god is the satirical cynicism gold. I'm happy your critique is getting recognition enough for me to find it.
I will say I’ve had the least amount of issues from my AirPods. Every other Bluetooth headphones I’ve owned has given me various issues. Though the price tag is high compared to the usual $50 or less pairs I’ve owned. I do lose one on like a weekly basis but that’s also cause I just put one down randomly and forget where I put it.
me with my ali express 5 dollar airpods flexing them like im rich lmfaoo
"When I first stumbled upon your channel, i was convinced it was going this bread tube stereotype, of pointing out something genuinely disturbing about pop/consumerist culture, and then take a biiiiig fat shit on it by harping on and on about their little puritanical mormon-esque religion of marxist ideology. 
I have to say, I can only admire a creator for opting to let their viewers draw their own conclusions from biased material, rather than forcefeeding them ideological talking points and antiquated citations from irelevant sycophants; even if the easy option would just have been to demonize capitalism as a cureall for society"
"Cool video but the conspiracy theorist part hasnt aged well, has it?"
"Again another informative video topped with great humor!

I wonder if Ordinary Things will ever talk about Multi Level Marketing companies like Jeunesse, might end up being an interesting topic to cover."
Literally just watched this twice in a row. Thanks for the great content. Looking forward to the next one.
Lmao imagine using in-ear headphones
"I roll with a high end wireless noise-cancellation headset. I just unplug my receiver from my PC and plug it into my phone to go out. The one time somebody commented on it he said ""Dude that looks cool as hell."" Steelseries, if anybody cares. Sleek metallic look and the sound is insane. I can actually go mow the lawn with them on and listen to chill music. I also can just pull the mic out of this sort of sliding containment area and answer calls with it, and the person I talk to enjoys my positional mic and its own technology so they get no background noise."
Bought some $20 knock offs...couldn't be happier with em.
Also you can just plug wired earphones into any device. There's no limit on the amount of devices you can connect to but with Bluetooth earphones its a pain to switch between devices and you are often limited to 2
I always keep a pair of wired headphones as backup they've saved my phone so many times
Bluetooth traveling between each ear through your brain is not a good thing.
I absolutely mentally prepared myself for this video being sponsored by Raycon. A+ for the restraint.
people that cut 3.5mm headphone cables deserve to lose an airpod they have to replace as a whole unit
"Airpods disappointed me so much that when I later got a set of Samsung AKG Pro's I left them in the box for a couple of months until a few noisy days at work had me dig them out..... 

What a mistake, these things are actually awesome  the noise cancelling is brilliant, and they've not fallen out of my ears once. Just a shame my set came in rose gold colour "
"Got the sony xm4. Did not try the Apple headphones, but I could recommend Sony for the noice cancelling. Sound could be a big better for the price. That is, some say playing around with the equalizer would improve this, which I still have to do."
'Courage' I think you meant 'Greed' Apple.
I never realised how much I hate the wire hanging off me when I use headphones until I used a wireless set for a little while
Apple also owns beats so this feels redundant
"I  bought a pair of wired in-ears for 9 euros like 6 years ago and they still work perfectly. Literally never been bothered by the wire, just move it out of the way or hide it under your jacket. This just seems like a pair of bluetooth headsets but without the microphone which would make them useful."
Another great video. Well done! There were some volume jumps when you started shouting though. Hope you can sort that out.
I lost my charger box thing and still have both AirPods because shit they were too expensive to throw out…
You are spot on. I myself went for gen 1 airpods because I already was using wireless ones and airpods where just better sound wise. The price was decent also. Gen 1 at apple always sucks so they died within a year. I just grabbed the pro. The build quality is decent. Am also a fan of the Sony x1000. But yeah these have become lifestyle more than anything.
As an AirPod and AirPod pro owner I disagree with almost everything this man is saying. I’m not a fan of apple but AirPods are great. (Fuck the overhead ones tho)
"I prefer V-MODA. Did a lot of searching. It's the absolute best brand I found.
Also wireless headphones/earbuds have lower sound quality and often lag a few seconds behind.
Maybe apple has a special codec to minimalize that, but it's still definitely there."
I bought the ten dollar set from 5 below. They have worked great in the warehouse for over a year.
I use AirPods because I found them on the ground and it’s convenient. I would never pay for them.
Omg thank you for pointing out how sus these damn headphones are 
did you know there's a hidden 3mm jack in your iphoneX. Just use a power drill to uncover and enjoy your wired headphones
"Literally the only advantage I can think of with wireless headphones is the ability to wear them in the bath. 
I know 2 people who take baths regularly enough to make use out of that in the first place, and they still run the risk of water damage if you drop them."
"It takes real ""courage"" to deprive people of basic needs in order to get a thundering applause from the hivemind"
I’m watching this with AirPod Pros in my ears right now. Lol.
I understand they aren’t the magic that marketing promises but I actually really love the features of my air pods and I think they are really great. I can exercise without them falling out. Cords always bothered me.
Everyone remember that episode of Doctor Who where cybermen used wireless earbuds to mind control people? Haha that's NEVER going to happen...
I bought some wireless headphones (the big ones that go on your head not in your ears) for £8 and they work perfectly.
"You do great content! Really enjoy your videos, you deserve way more subscribers"
Apple headphones hurt my ears. I’ll stick to my $50 Sony wireless headphones with a connector cord so it’s slightly harder to lose
You make me remember the definition of exclusivity. Thanks
The total number of airpods apple has sold is also the  total number of inevitable e waste since airpods are designed not to be repairable
"Pllllleeeease dude, make videos more often! YouTube recommended one of your videos some weeks ago and I've watched each one of them. Keep it up!"
"When I initially found your channel you had 60k subs that wasnt long ago at all, great job mastering the algorithm Things!"
They are uncomfy to me. And my old cloud 2's have a lot better price to quality when compared to the airpods.
Been binge watching you the past month. I love your videos dude please keep going.
If you want a good version of this product skull candy has a really good version that I've had working great for almost a year now
"Honestly, as someone who uses Wired headphones almost exclusively, I have this to say:
They will almost always sound better than the Wireless headphones for the same price. Why? Space inside them, and I'm not talking about the size of the speaker drivers either. Simply put, in order for the speaker to wiggle at the right speeds to reproduce the noises of whatever you want to listen to, the digital file on your phone has to get turned into an analog signal. To do this, a piece of Circuity called a Digital to Analog Converter, or DAC is used."
Surprisingly you didn't mention that they are unfixable and disposable after 3 years. Basically the perfect product if you are a big tech company
im listening to this with my air pods.
I would love to see you deep dive into the history of baby formula. It is quite the rabbit hole.
I never got the hype around earbuds. They are shittier than headphones and more uncomfortable. If I want to listen to music I just put on wired headphones and enjoy them. I don't even know if I own any wired ones and I definitly never bought wireless earBUTTS.
"You can buy a singular air pod replacement, it’s overpriced but you can do it if you lose one. You do not have to buy a whole new set."
"Seems pretty clear that the comment section here hates Apple, so I guess I'll state an unpopular opinion: I kinda love my Airpods. 

Still going strong on 2 years of ownership, and being freed from the wire which commonly pulled my in-ears out when being caught on something or when making some awkward movement, zipping my jacket, whatever. My Airpods have survived countless drops, and while their battery has gotten worse with time, they're still perfectly usable and charge very quickly. "
Nice way to pump the cancerous radio waves directly into the head.
"Apple have all the courage to keep making bizarre mistakes. Having to work on a 2017 Macbook without a physical escape key makes me wish for an escape. Vim/Vi without an escape key is just needlessly painful, but its even worse when your MacBook freezes up again and you're unable to use it for commands, such as option-command-escape (apple's ctrl alt del). They always put form over function."
"You can tell if someone is an apple fanboy if they defended and recommended airports max on YouTube. They are almost twice as much as Sony xm4 while only having a little better noise cancelation, plus they like all other apple products only work well with other apple products."
"My ears sweat a lot, and I would burn through 3-4 pairs of earbuds per year consistently as one would always stop working. I tried every major brand, cheap ones, expensive ones, and ones made specifically for exercising and all would burn out. Got a pair of wireless ones that are waterproof and no issues for 2 years now and so I've already came out ahead spending less than I was before. Although eventually I'm sure the battery will go to crap..."
"The Air Pods max are in a weird situation. Sure they are pretty much some of the best Bluetooth headphones you can buy, but for their hi-fi price they are still bluetooth headphones. Pretty much any hi-fi wired headphone will blow them out of the water"
10/10 for Ghost Fight alone tbh
You should do an episode on chocolate since some of what you mentioned in the nestle video sparked my interest on the topic and it's a pretty ordinary thing.
"I bought ones. I regret it. 
I have tinny hears it gets discusting with hear wax, the batery doesn't last 10 songs. 
I still use mine 5 year old headphones and they are way better for me. 
I end up gaving the airpods to my little brother"
"I'm personally still long-against separately synced wireless earbuds. Banded headphones, be them wireless earbuds with a cable, or on/over ear headsets, are still okay for wireless, but as two completely separate items doing one stereolithic function, there are just too many things that can go wrong; different levels of charge, meaning one dies before the other, one falls out, leaving you with a single ear blaster, the internal componentry could corrode, or the battery expand, separately, etc. And the tiny size only limits them in capability and bettery life."
This channel is the best thing that happened to me in 2020
Lol it was clearly on trending in the USA. Try to not spread misinformation no matter how small it may seem.
This channel goes way beyond entertainment. Its literal public service
I love my airpods. Can't go back to wired now
"I still love like my macbook, but back in the day I used to be into iPhones and upgrade them regularly, I was part of the sheeple. Now a days, having a phone of any kind is not a flex. The casm is not like automobiles where the experience is that noticeable.  
Ultimately, it's a tool for maps, replaces a camera (big brother as a diaspora) and texting."
High quality wireless headphones with active noise cancelling have been ~$500 for years. Also Apple doesn't sell the most expensive smartphones. Samsung's A120 ultra bigBoy is ~$1500. But I have always bought my apple products second hand and had a blast. Or else I pick up the iPhone that is last year's model when I need a new phone and it's usually at a clearance level discount. And I'm always able to get minimum 2 years out of it and then pass it off to a family member to use for another 2-4 years. Not bad.
Me watching this video with AirPods.
I'm torn between hating Apple's awful anticonsumer practices and respecting the hell out their abilities to just completely fleece normies at every turn. It's complicated.
The biggest problem is that the battery life goes away quick
I was wondering where you went. I honestly thought 2020 wasn't done with you. Also that blue background gets the people going!
I'm glad to see that subscriber count go up every video you post!!
"I have those Sony near it's, in fact I'm using them to watch this video right now."
Finally an episode . Keep it up my guy
"Oh, ya know, me here with my Android with a headphones jack "
How is that possible that it needs an algorithm to show me your content?!? I love it 
This man really out here green screening a blue screen. I love you
airpods are great because you can hijack the bluetooth ;)
"Okay I have to correct you @ 3:00 you say you you can't buy the separate air pods, if you ask at the Apple store they'll sell you each individual part for £70"
Still going to use air buds into the foreseen future
I have not heard someone so confidently proclaim that their podcast is funny
"""but they might be the first to be offered with a monthly payment plan"" ok, this got me curious, how much does something need to cost for Americans to pay for it in installments?"
I wear mine all the time
"As with a lot of people, after you were recommended I subscribed and went on a binge haha"
I'd love to keep using my wired headphones...IF EVERY OTHER FUCKING MANUFACTURER DIDN'T FOLLOW APPLE AND REMOVED THE 3.5 MM JACK!
I don’t care what anybody says about airpods but for me they are the best item I have owned in a long time and here is my reasoning: To my ears they are the most comfortable earbuds I’ve used. It almost feels like they are not there most of the time so they never start to irritate my ears. Also I like the design. A lot of the other earbuds on the market look way too bulky for my taste. The real game changer is that they are wireless. My wires used to get stuck on the door handles and what not and then would violently detach from my ears. I also like to use earbuds while I’m on bed so there is no wires all over me while laying around. They are also great for working out since they are light and you don’t get sweaty around your ears (unlike traditional headphones in my experience). Charge time is also very quick and they last surprisingly long. Only negative thing is the price but I do feel like I got my money worth since they don’t seem to break unlike every wired earbuds I’ve owned. Also they sound great for an earbud.
"This content is now legally defined as ""Stupidly good"" as in its so ridiculous how good it is. I hope the fame doesnt hurt the content but the pay off is 100% deserved"
Seeing kids in my highschool wearing air pods makes me think that they are broke
Another masterpiece lad. Keep it up
"Lol, I'm wearing airpods while watching this, "
"To be fair, if you call Apple they can replace only the left or right AirPod if you lost one"
You know they do sell them individually right? You just need tl buy them through Support
You can buy a single Airpods if you've lost one
"Ahoy, Gentleman Pirate! Started watching your videos today, kudos. Took a couple, till an older one with black hair, to finally recognise you!"
So removing the headphone jack made us better people?
"The worst aspect about these headphones is that the batteries are not replaceable. Unlike the majority of audio devices made in the last 50 years, these are disposable."
Can't wait for the follow-up video on Samsung bone conductor headphones
You know you can buy just a single replacement AirPod don’t you?
Do an episode on calendars! Also I love you.
"Meh, your loss if you don't buy Sony bluetooth headphones instead of these. Cheaper, good sound quality, good battery life, charges quickly and feel super comfortable."
"Whether these are wired or not the drones walking around with pending hearing loss issues and ever diminishing situational awareness are a vomit inducing sight. The ultimate escapism from reality is to walk in front of a car. Normal people need all their senses sharp, but these bozos are keen on sensory or biochemical sedation in order to make it through the day."
"For roughly the same price you can buy a pair of sennheiser hd15 mk2s that are the industry standard for audio monitoring in live settings as well as for DJs

Airpods are expensive and that's literally their only appeal. (Because something being expensive has become a positive thing now "
Honestly the only reason I use wireless headphones (not airpods) is because I killed a lot of wired headphones catching the wires on door handles etc
I binged all of your videos in one evening.
"Jesus christ, those apple headphones have got to be a joke. I bought my wireless (has wire as optional built in) headphones from a electronic store for 769kr (somewhere around 70 dollars) and they are high fidelity 80+h battery life headphones from Marshalls (the audiophile company). And I thought 700+kr was expensive.... Makes me glad I'm not a brainlet like my little brother who cares about brands."
This man is speaking the language of the gods
"I remember when all you needed to find was your wallet and car keys. Now, i not only need to find them and my effing phone and ipad but also all three effing pieces of my effing airpod thingy."
POV: Your listening to this on your airpods
"They only time I actually like using wireless Earbuds is at the gym. Other than that, wired all the way. Crazy how my $10 wired Sony earbuds sound indefinitely better than the $160 airpods or $300 klipsch wireless earbuds. So glad I got one of the last few phones still made with a jack, I'm holding on to it until it disintegrates in my hands."
"Im a mess and im always pulling the cord of the headphones from my phone, fucking the headset or making my phone go through the air and cracking, i.e. this phone im writting right now.

But fuck apple, theres plenty of wireless headphones brands than offer a better sound, better wearabillity, and better price."
The wake up sheeple schtick was hilarious
Looks like your gaining traction! Keep it up....King. 
Apple: weaponizing the veblen effect since we found out what that is!
"There definetely is a big argument for wireless headphones, like the fact that, as it has no cable, there's no cable to break, that has been the sole reason every wired heaphone I've had broke, the fucking cable."
Watching this while looking at two sets of AirPods ahahah
You were mentioned in the eboys podcast and I was so spaced out that memeulous them watched you
"I get your general point, but i still disagree.  I believe that you cannot judge a company for making a product that is not dangerous.  You can make fun of the customers for paying to much etc.  But on the other hand, AirPods (and other wireless headphones) do have advantages.  I say this as a “wired user” (which I use because I like the sound quality better)"
Solution: just don't buy Apple
"Just go OnePlus Bullets if you want reasonably priced, battery efficient, fast charging, small but secure earbuds. They do that neck wrap thing so they’re not so annoyingly easy to lose."
"Lol airpods max, the most expensive non professional professional headphones available, rejected by audiophiles everywhere."
"Raycon missed an easy layup for a sponsorship here, lol"
That sarcasm at 6:37 was subtle as fuck lmao. You gotta do a 500k Q&A or something fam.
"9:36 - Let's be real, they don't look cool. They look like like a couple of macarons that have been laying outside for so long, even its food colouring is gone. And its headband looks like it's waiting for something to get ripped by."
No better way to make someone feel exclusive & special than to just slap a $150% markup on it
"Someone tried flexing their airpod maxes on me. I own hifiman aryas which are 1,200 dollars more lol. They are not wireless and need to be plugged into a shit ton of other stuff for maximum quality. I also own hifiman anandas which had a price drop of 40% to 599 and are a LOT better for the money."
"Also, as an audio engineer I can promise you earbuds are TERRIBLE for your ears and hearing."
"Apple basically has two product divisions: Consumer and Business.

Their business products are the MacPro, iMac Pro, 16"" MacBook Pro, iPad Pro + Pencil and Pro Display XDR. They all make sense in the business market and are actually priced competitively (people who thought $52,000 for a kitted-out MacPro are in for a shock when they start looking at options such as the Dell Precision 7800 that retails for something like $70,000 in the same spec). That's where Apple makes sense as tech company."
9:00 THOSE ARE LITERALLY JUST HEADPHONES!
You are a wonderful man! 
Apple sells so many AirPods that it’s more than some countries GDP
Love this guy
"Correct me if I’m wrong, but this guy’s making some flimsy arguments. The OG AirPods were definitely clunky and risked falling out way more easily than the pros, but the pros have never fallen out for me even during excessive workouts. The noise cancellation is useful af sometimes, same with transparency mode. Also, looking for 1 disconnected pod literally only happens to me if I use them in bed, and only occasionally at that as opposed to having to untangle wires almost every day. Not to mention the sound quality on both are nicer than most wired earbuds. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had earbuds annoyingly yanked out during a commute, etc, sometimes even damaging the wire and ruining the product altogether. Plus, they’re Bluetooth... which makes them great options for plenty of devices. The only thing that I think is a crime against anyone is the price of the Max’s, but those are mostly for fanboys anyway; they don’t offer nearly enough of a practical advantage to warrant the cost."
The memes that came out of the AirPods launch was the funniest Shit ever tho. Then they got added to a meme with the “waves” hairstyle lol
Well there goes any chance of a Raycon sponsorship.
"Airpods are uncomfortable, and Apple uses Samsung parts in their phones."
"1. You can buy them secondhand, I bought a second left airpod
2. It's not anyone's fault if you lose your own headphones

I think your argument is mostly your disdain over AirPods encapsulating what is wrong with consumerism/hype/Apple itself and not with the product. The battery is great, charging is fast and sound quality is good enough. They sell well primarily because they're a good product and secondarily because they're Apple imo. "
been waiting for a new one
And now all 3.5mm jacks are gone and we'll never go back. 
Courage was the reason ️
i would use the corded headphones but i cant be asked to buy a new usb c to headphones jack every 2 weeks
"Head phones are better anyways can't lose a whole big bulky headphones, plus their just more stylish."
As a former phone store salesman AirPods and other apple products were both the worst thing to ever happen to me and also the greatest. This completely depended on supply which Apple controls and most definitely uses as a marketing ploy for instance the reason an Apple launch is so crazy is because they only supply a tiny number of phones for the first few months ensuring that people get desperate for frankly a pretty standard phone with a huge price. With the iPhone 7 launch my city got 100 phones of all types and the cheaper options were the rarest my store had one black iPhone 7 32gb and we didn’t get any more for 2 months.
Apple DO sell them individually lol
"Honestly, AirPods are not very good, sound quality wise, especially for the cost. For about 3 years, I used a pair of Sol Republic earbuds, which were far better quality wise, more comfortable, not bright white, and didn’t have that ugly as sin tampon string. For almost two years now I’ve been using a pair of Sennheiser earbuds, and they have been miles beyond the Apples in quality of sound, battery life, total life(Still work perfectly, with a roughly 4 hour battery after 2 years), have a larger capacity charging case, better technical support, look far better, have touch pads on the outside to control volume and song selection just by swipe without using your phone, and the case is smaller. Plus, they have a small light on the inside part that flashes routinely while they are on, so if you accidentally drop one while using it, you just have to look for the flashing light. All of this for $80 CAD cheaper. Don’t buy AirPods, guys, the status isn’t worth the shitty sound and practicality."
Apple clearly loves the smell of their own farts
"Wired headphones and earphones are just better. My dad is on calls for most of the day and he swears by AirPods, but these are his 4TH PAIR IN 4 YEARS, 1 being a pro. On 2 of them, the batteries just stopped working because he dropped them so much (they're very droppable). The others haven't broken but sound horrible now with a buzzy feeling in the ears (dropping problem again). He's lost them many many times too. Also, wired headphones just HAVE BETTER AUDIO QUALITY than wireless ones. AirPods aren't worth it smh, stop buying them citizens of Earth."
"The cult of apple is real and also very stupid. I had a co-worker try to flex on me with his airbuds, so I pointed out that in own wireless in-ear earbuds were from Bang & Olufsen, he said ""yeah, but mine are more expensive"" until I pointed out that mine were double the price of his, and that he hasn't heard of B&O because their speaker technology is usually only usually used in high end luxary cars and electronic goods. His response was ""... Yeah, but apple is just better""."
I've personally never understand the point of any iPhone product..my mate has had so many problems with her phone and changing it 5x in the last few years when I've had the same phone since 2018 and it's still working fine and not a single problem but I'm probs just being cheap 
Just killed his chance at a raycon sponsorship
Worst thing about airpods for me is the fact their just hard plastic instead of having that nice soft cushion even dollar store earbuds have so your ear doesnt feel like its been pounded with a rock all night.
I hate these things. I got a pair of over the ear headphones for like $40 and the quality is amazing. Just not named after a piece of fruit or a rapper
You seem to be the only content creator that knows that patreon subscribers are called patrons
"Apple does sell individual airpods, but only if you say it's a repair. Even then they're 70 DOLLARS AN EAR 
90 FOR THE PROS. 
ASK ME HOW I KNOW."
You forgot to mention that Wired headphones sound better as well
I bought a new phone not realising it didn't have an aux jack ️
"Thank you for making these, cannot wait to listen to the podcast just to have more content from you, you're genuinely the best youtube channel I have found all year and I love every second of your vids. Also your collabs with Internet Historian are amazing"
Loved this. Always thought it was weird how the internet seemed to go from mocking to praising these on a dime.
Listening to this on my AirPods
"Mr. Person! I was worried you had gone into witness protection, It's great to see you're still spaffing out great content, I love your work! Keep it up, and don't let the bastards grind you down."
"9:13 Yep, I have that same exact Sony Over-The-Ear Headset (USED: $95), which INDEED LASTS 30HRS!!!
- HELL, even my ""SHITE"" Wal-Mart ""Onn-Brand"" Wireless Bluetooth Horseshoe Headset Earbuds have really nice sound quality AND last a similar 24-30HRS for only $30 Brand-New!!! As I've already stated, I. HATE. APPLE!!! They're overpriced & mediocre, FFS!!!*"
"I’ve had my pair for probably three years and they’re still functioning like new. In that same amount of time idk how many wired headphones Ike have lost or broken. Personally, I love them."
I have loved binge these videos and I am glad to see that you are finally hitting the spotlight you deserve.
As I watch with AirPods 
"Never seen your videos until recently and i really enjoy them. Excellent, relaxing, informative and humours entertainment. Keep making more !"
"Great, now I cant unsee that he doesn't comb his hair"
"That status symbol selling point is right on the money. I worked in a store and the amount of people calling in to see if we sold airpods was legit insane. I actually felt glad telling them ""no"" since it would be saving them some money the stupid basterds."
"A very pleasant late christmas gift

Thanks internet historian for recommending this. "
POV: your watching this with AirPods in
"I really love your content and style of video making, it’s very enjoyable and easily digestible"
Lok i have a 25 year old pair of Sony DJ's that still work just great.
bro thank you for all these videos you make. they are all  very well made and i cant stop watching them. Thank you for being a “good” youtuber. hard to come by these days with all these people just tryna make a buck or two with their shitty money grabber videos. You have gained my respect <3
"I prefer the happy medium, Bluetooth headphones with a wire between them, that way I can leave my phone on charge on the side while I do cooking or whatever, and I can pause/ change the volume without getting my phone out (like with wired headphones) they’re way cheeper than AirPods/ equivalent too (£20 for a half decent set)"
"i have never bought an apple product, my phone is so cheap it could be classified as a burner, and i really only use my computer for work, the question is why did i watch this?"
Having an audio jack was one of my criteria when I chose my new phone. Sometimes cheap phones are better.
It's painfully obvious none of you ever owned  good true wireless headphones
"i get it. i also don't like apple for a variety of reasons but this kinda just seems like a vid about wireless pods/buds in general. yea, wires have a lotta benefits, but pods or any variation are huge game changers when it comes to certain things like exercising and for me, playing drums. as for the apple side, it was just very effective marketing catered to ""apple-type"" people (for a lack of a better phrase...lol). yea apple sucks, but the pods and that concept are pretty cool imo. until one goes missing in my couch cushions ;)"

"oh, I didn't know that those ear tampons play pop-music."
It's courage guys not getting rid of something convenient and forcing you to get a more expensive product
"Incorrect, headphones do have batteries it's just that battery is what they are plugged into. They should use the same amount of power just one way you have to charge a extra device and the other you don't."
"more or less your not paying for the product your paying for the brand and that elitist symbolism that says ""hey i have money please do not mug me"""
Another good video.
"""Raycon good, wires bad!"""
Courage. Like relying on fruit juice to cure your pancreatic cancer.
What about the radiation from the Bluetooth system?
"i love wired earphones cuz i can just solder the broken connections when they get broken (fun fact, headphones are designed so that they ""break"" after like a year or 2, the coonectins on the speakers and wires is basically just taped on lol)"
Muffet‘s theme rocks
Love the foil on his head
At this point seeing a downward spiral in a video is not a joke is culture that the future generations will love and appreciate
Apple took a page out of Hachikuji's book. The courage to fuck over customers
"7:02 ""during this sales period, over 130 wireless headphones were sold worldwide ..."" lol I think you dropped a couple of zeros there bud"
However much annoying  wired headphones are when the wires tangle at least I don't have to worry about my headphones running out of battery whilst an adult film is on
I hate it when I drop my Airpods down the terlit.
Ordinary Foilhead becoming best OC
"One of his eyes is crying, other ones tears were lost"
"To be fair, i love true wireless earbuds, i got my first  pair 2 years ago and now I'm currently using my airpods pro. I would never go back,  no cables that get tangled or broken (which happeneded to me on a yearly basis),  i can walk around and still be on a phone call without having to carry my phone (or my laptop since i use them to zoom a lot), they pair instantly, they have great sound and great mic and the batter is pretty good. I am not scared of losing them because i'm not a 10 years old child. Apple or not apple, tws eaarbuds are awesome in my opinion."
"I bought some earbuds for 15€, they have really good sound and after year of intense usage they still work perfectly. my point is that airpods are an overpriced turd."
"I don’t wanna sound like apple fanboy but... idk I never actually lost my AirPods, i don’t think it’s that hard to care about your belongings. And if you lose/break one of the AirPods or the charging case you can go to apple store to either replace it or get a new AirPod or charging case and it’s obviously cheaper than buying a new set of them"
I personally like the whole wireless headphones. Theyre great for running if you find a good pair that sticks in your ear.
"God I want to make new accounts to that I can thumbs-up this thing about 100 times. I'm so sick of putting up with apple's bullshit, just to avoid being a green bubble."
This is easily one of my favourite channels. Keep it up!
"Hey Mr. Things, thanks for the content and the reminder that we already live in a dystopian future :D"
Don’t know where you tried buying the single AirPods but in uk you can get them. Not cheap but available
"Oh thank god, I watched every ordinary things video after your Quibi video got recommended to me and I’ve been waiting for you to make a new video ever since. Really happy I can say I subbed to this channel when it just started out. You’re gonna blow up soon keep up the good work"
It takes courage to act as a psychopath when you aren't one. Does that make it good?
"Hey @Ordinary Things,
I see your Chroma Key is having problems with your hair. There be an easy way to fix that...
Try using the Chroma Key effect more than once. On the first pass, remove only the background than expand/inflate the boarder (usually a slider called ""choke""), then use a second instance of the effect for the finer details."
"As someone with the Sony XM4s, I appreciate the compliment at the end.

Also they're really fucking good. I basically do wear them 24/7 at this point"
Apple forgot to do one thing..... They didn't give me a reason to buy them.
Love the show! Joined your patreon. Make one a week pleeeeeasseee!
What about generic blue tooth headphones?
I’m not a massive fan of Apple but I really enjoy using my AirPods. Yet to lose them and they’re comfortable as hell
the timing on this video is so good. i just saw an ad for the plus headphones while i was pumping gas and laughed out loud when i saw the price. it was akward
I do like a good set of bluetooth ear muffs . . . thats right apple dont support bluetooth.
"They removed the audio jack by conveniently running out of space at the same time as they started to push hard the Air Pods. Now they finally decided to add wireless charging to their tracking devices, in  the next couple of years the charging port will go in the way of the dodo."
I too shall be sticking with the wires.
an actually cool wireless piece of tech: bone conducting headsets. they're great when you actually have to hear things but you want some background music as well - jogging/cycling (or hiding them under a hat at work)
It's sometimes comforting to know you aren't the only one thinking most of the stuff in this video
I love my motorola phone and jabra earbuds. 
Great video! The tin foil hat version of you really made me laugh :D
"How do you easily herd sheep?
Release a new iPhone."
I love your videos! As soon as I discovered you I binged all your videos. I look forward to what's next!
My wireless headphones ran out of batteries while watching this. I feel attacked... Fantastic as usual.
I hope the apple heads get better eyes as they might get hit by cyclests or cars trying to push cyclests off there road.
"I've worked in cellular for the past decade, let me tell you that Apple is literally just about the price tag. You are better off going by LG Bluetooth. There's literally no difference besides the price. Usually Apple has been late to the game on most of their stuff. Anyway great to see your numbers up mate, can't believe you got this many views and a couple hours and you had on most of your videos a few weeks ago. You deserve it!"
Damn things don't even sound that good!
"I only got into wireless earbuds when I found a pair for about 20 dollars that's lasted me at least as long as similarly priced wired earbuds. The two have advantages and disadvantages from each other and I think it's at least worth a shot. 

But fuck the 160 dollar pricetag for earbuds and fuck the culture of shunning people who think about their purchases for more than a microsecond."
"watching this with airpods. I miss the wire. Sometimes, wired is just better. Sometimes wireless is great, but not giving consumers choice is my least favorite thing about Apple. I’m looking forward to getting out of this ecosystem."
"Dude's hair is the real crime against the head tho, amiright."
I'm sticking with the wires for hygienic reasons. Hand contact with something that goes in your ear makes for both dirty hands and ears.
Airborne Toxic Event is a great band!!
"Love how apple makes people pay more for lower audio quality. Even with other Bluetooth headphones they are subpar (which most have the problem of needing to compress audio before sending it to headphones anyways, so you lose quality)."
I have the AirPods and the Sony headphones you showed in the end! Mainly now use the AirPods for phone calls and conference calls. I wear the Sony for listing to music and podcasts. Love them both tbh
"Courage to move forward but then again bluetooth has not the bandwith for Hi-Fi audio, which is why it's no wonder my $4 Chi-Fi QKZ VK4 sounds better than Apple's glorified earplug ಠ‿ಠಠ‿ಠಠ‿ಠ"
It’s nice to know there is at least one other person on this planet who also has that conspiracy theory. The second I saw “AirPods for Christmas” trending I was like “this is a little too convenient for apple...”
"First reactions to air pods
footage of an actual dumpster fire as background"
7:02 I would imagine over 130 wireless headphones were sold in this period I would have guessed a lot higher
I wanted to give you the best chance of saying your point so I watched the whole video. I haven't regretted watching something as much as I do right now for a long time. Try to lighten up about these things and realise that the only way to get to the magical future in our minds is to move towards it - not stagnate with imperfect compromises that you only respect because you were born into a time they were already present in.
"I'm so sick or wireless earbuds only good for working out, wireless headphones for me thanks! Also if you call wireless earbuds headphones: please leave lol."
"7:02 ""During this sales period, over 130 wireless headphones were sold worldwide"" 

I'm sure they did lmao"
Apple can make whatever products they like for all I care. What I truly hate them for is removing headphone jacks for no real reason and because they happen to be the trendsetters you can barely find a new phone with a headphone jack now.
I’m so happy I found your videos. Keep up the great work man!
"It's been far too long brother, glad you're back! Turn my world on its head!"
7:03 that sounds like a major step down from over 60 million
I like my air pods because tangled wires are the bane of my existence and the auto-pause when you remove them I find is a lot nicer than fumbling for the button on the wires
"""I hope next year will be better""... it wasn't, (but I found your channel, so there were some diamonds anyway.)"
"What I will say about wired headphones is, the cord will endlessly get stuck on things and the headphones get pulled out of your ears. This ruins the cord in the long run and you have to get new ones because you have only audio in one ear, unless you keep fiddling with the cord. Which I find far more annoying than having to recharge my headphones."
I’m concerned about the long term health affects of Bluetooth right next to our brains
Listening on my AirPods 
"i actually use Sony's one piece wireless headphones, but i have the version that its tiny and has a microphone/its own player, so you just press one button and you can hear even better than without them in your ears, and the battery lasts around 8-6 hours (the box says 16 but that's BS)"
"Me watching this with my airpods on
: hmmm interesting"
"I am totally guilty, I use Linux, Android annnnnd Airpod Pros. I lost my first set on a trip in the mountains, and bought another set the day I got home. They are simply that good, every friend of mine that has tried them ended up up with a set a few months later. They aren't even a status thing, I think they look goofy and don't wear them in public, they are just damn good, and noise canceling is that awsome for us outdoorsy people. (I found my first set on another trip 4 months later. Totally fine except for some yellowing on the pods. I gave them to my father who used the crap out of them. Before eventually loosing one pod)"
Loving the serious but funny and educational content.
"I compared $35 Skullcandy Sesh Evo wireless earbuds to AirPods. Same quality, if not I'd actually say the Skullcandy buds have better sound. Skullcandy Sesh are $35 and Airpods are what, $199? Wake up sheeple"
Personally I can’t live without a pair of wireless earbuds because there convenient and everything I own is from apple anyway so I went for airpods over the other brands ️
Sony headphones are pretty good
Just discovered your channel and subscribed. Awesome content. Been binge watching... Youtube algorithm strikes again for me!
"Honestly this is why I enjoy Bose wireless headphones over anything else. I’ve never been much of a fan of earbuds of any kind. They’re big so they can’t be easily lost and they have a longer battery life. Plus, they can be easily converted to wire headphones with a cord."
"""Kool aid chuggers"" lmao I'm stealing this."
I used to be a stickler about wired earbuds (still use an iPhone 6S to retain the headphone jack lol) but cheap true wireless earbuds have gotten really good for really cheap as of late. I got a $40 pair from a Chinese company a couple months back and they’re really impressive for the price.
Missed opportunity to refer to it as crimes against head
"Given how ubiquitous they are on Youtube and the subject at hand, I was kind of expecting to see a Raycon sponsorship.

You know, the ones that go on and on about their earpods and fail to mention the they have fucking awesome headphones that also benefit from sponsor codes."
"I own the Bose wireless earbuds, but I only ever use them if I'm at work because I like the convenience of wireless without the hassle of dealing with cables.  And I only ever have one of the buds in so I can still hear and talk to people."
My vibing with my AirPods Pro’s be like 
Apple has the courage to charge you 5 times the price for half the performance.
Watching this with my AirPods
Last apple product I had was a Macbook Pro in 2013. That laptop from 8 years ago had more features than any mac has today lol.
I'm shocked you didn't mention the eco-waste NIGHTMARE the product and it's competitors has created :( These things are non-repairable and a ton of effort to recycle for parts
"I dont get the point of TWS earpods, I mean if you want Bluetooth IEMs I'd get some that only require one DAC and amp because there would be better sound quality"
I got the headphone adapter with my phone.  And I met a very nice man in a giving mood who gave me his headphone adapter because he switched to Android.
Can we talk about sonys naming system? Holy fuck
This channel deserves a couple million subs at the least - may the YouTube algorithm be in your favour
These honestly remind of the bluetooth earphones people used to never take out of their ears. It just ends up making the user look stupid.
Head phones are just better all round more comfortable most of time
7:07 Woah! Hard to believe they sold almost 150 units. But I guess that's what makes them apple
Watching this with AirPods lol
I just started watching your videos and they are super good. Keep up the great work :)
"Airpods are way overpriced but I do love (cheaper) wireless earbuds. Just not being attached to my phone by a wire is great. I can stand up and move around without having to juggle my phone all the time, if I don't have pockets I can put my phone in my bag, and dropping a phone while you have a wired earbud in your ear is one of the worst feelings imo."
Yall complained but yall still bought them anyway traitors
THIS CHANNEL IS THE BEST THING 2020 GAVE ME  ️️️
Watching this now from a Samsung with no earphone jack and wireless JBLs.....
"I have watched every single one of your videos now, thank you for this blessing of a new one!!"
"These videos are so entertaining, but I swear to you, I SWEAR, this man always has to find a reason to say NUCULAR."
My issue - the sound sucks. Premium wireless earphones just don't exist. My 5 year old earphones were laundered 3 times and they still wipe the floor with any cordless set.
"I can't seem to find a good pair of earbuds that last me longer than a year, so i bought tautronics wireless earbuds a few months back. I gotta say I'm satisfied with the quality and they we're dirt cheap, like 30 euros."
The thing I dislike the most is that these scheisters lead the industry so now everybody has ditched the 3.5 jack and is doing all the same blatently anti consumer crap. Why wouldn't they when idiots will bow down and worship anything apple spits out not just despite the additional cost for nothing but because of it.
"more frequent videos please, i love your content. Always entertaining. also tell internet historian to hurry up and post"
"So glad I saw you on internet historian, love the content "
and you can get better audio quality with wired
"And this is why I buy discounted wired skullcandy sets. Good quality, I like the look, and cheap af."
"imo bluetooth headphones have niche uses, but for shit like a mobile phone why bother. it's not worth it considering the battery, the lower quality audio, the higher cost, etc."
Get the Max version so that you can listen to people without needing to remove them. Problem solved. Avoid using Bluetooth headphones for too long though.
"Another great video, loving these latest ones."
Who’s listening to this on air pods
"If you guys want really good over-ear headphones, I personally like V-Moda M-100 & M-200. Very solid tech, durable as hell, and a very reasonable sticker price between $100-250 depending on the model.

Bose bluetooth earbuds are great too, and they're shaped to actually stick in your dang ear."
"you did't have to do my boy bluetooth like that, he ain't that old"
"Me when podcast gets a new episode with mic stand- ""Hell yeah"" 
Me when OT comes out with a new episode- ""Hell yeah"""
I like Bluetooth earbuds but I use cheaper ones that actually stay in my head and aren't weirdly shaped
"igot a motorola s9 wireless headset with free with a phone once, im still using it ten years later, battery is iffy but it will last me the average day, id buy another if i could rather than buy a pair of those gimmicky things"
"Ironic, I'm watching this after having gotten a pair of Bose QuietComfort headphones for Christmas. Damn you, Apple!"
someone's jealous they don't have airpods
"I appreciate you not making an among us reference when you said sus, truly you do this for the art."
"As a teacher I observed some students bullying another student because the former had cheap ""imposter"" airpods and not genuine ones (the kid was also poor)... i immediantly cut myself in and pointed out that at least they had not been suckered in by marketing that was aimed at those of easily manipulated intelligence to buy an expensive equivalent.
The previously bullied kid went away with a smile on their face... the bullies just looked dumbfounded."
"Apple cultference, ahaha xD Android Is Better -London Yellow"
How do you not have a million subscribers? This is great content!
conference or cultference? ;)
"Honestly, I'm really glad I don't deal have to deal with wires anymore, I have a pair of £30 encafire headphones from amazon, they work fine and have lasted longer than any other headphones that I've had, previously it was buy new headphones every 3-6months because the wire died the encafires have lasted me 2 years."
"Apple was right, no one uses jacks anymore. AirPods stick in your ears, look good, have built-in individual tracking, and have awesome sound quality. Oh and the battery life is like 24 hours... every complaint was addressed from the start."
Imagine buying apple products
So happy to see you succeed mate.
It is all about having to spend more money
"I've never had to worry about apple products, I always buy Samsung devices and wireless earphones that don't cost triple digits"
Personally I like my larger over the ear Sony headphones cos they have a feature that you can put your hand on your ear and it pauses the noise canceling & the music til you remove your hand
"I stiill don't get why they air called airpods. Pods make me think of, I dunno, Starfleet torpedo casings and pod people. And why the ""air"" part?
I would also probably make it a mandate that LL bloody phone companies use the same bloody output socket on their phone. MicroUSB works fine people no need to make them all different. "
I've only used wireless headsets not the wireless pods. I have always still had wired pods even if they're Bluetooth.
Sold more than 130 huh? Well I guess you're  not wrong
"To address the issue of losing your airpods, having to charge them, and needing a carrying case, introducing Apple Airpods Mega: a pair of noise cancelling audio cups connected by a rigid strap, and tethered to your phone by a piwer and data cable, utilizing the brand new iTunes connector on your iPhone."
"The whole point of Bluetooth - or any standard - is that you DON'T have to buy the overpriced brand item that goes with your other overpriced brand item - you can use ANY kind of Bluetooth headphone from ANY vendor, including higher-quality ones that are much cheaper."
fyck yeah fuck extra emf in my ear them squiggly lines r part of life
Fucking love you man. Keep up the excellent content. One of my favorite on this platform
Apples garbage
I use a pair of wired Shure 846 and often get contemptuous looks from proud Apple Air pods users.
"Holy crud so many subs in so little time! You've earned it, Congratulations!!!"
Thit guy and trap lore are brothers
"I'm going to be completely and 100% honest here. If I see someone wearing airpod max or whatever it is, I'm grabbing them off their head and running. Who the hell in their right mind would wear 500 dollars in the easiest to grab spot ever"
Please please please buy some toner for that hair 
Yeah... I bought a set of tautronics for 40 quid the other day. They actually fit in my ears and sound decent lol
I've been waiting for this for weeks. ️Thank you.
5:21 amog us
"I got AirPods for Christmas this year and so far have had no problems. I only use them for watching videos and usually only do that for a few hours at a time, so I haven’t had them die on me yet."
Air pods are apples most lazy product there took normal headphone cut of the wire stuck a battery in and did not change the shape then there charge over 159£ for them if you check your local drains your likely to find at least one air pod
Your presentation style is soo WINNINGG!  Srsly keep up the good work
Excellent work! Loving your videos dude!
"Wait a minute, did you not just lose Airpod and around  5 minutes you have both! Don't tell me you did what i think you did... lol anyway you took wine out of a toilet what else can i expect"
man watching this on my iPhone X and Apple 2nd Generation AirPods really elevated my experience!
It comes down to one-word MONEY!
Ordinary Man gets more fit with every episode
Great video! I enjoyed this immensely
2:58 literally watching this cuz this happened to my friend today
"Hate Apple but I like true wireless, especially just having the option of only using one and still being able to hear stuff around you. If it runs out of battery, just swap to the other ear"
I’m watching this while wearing airpods.
"Being someone who loses their bank cards and wallet on a near monthly basis, thank fuck I never bought into Wireless earphones. My Sennie HD-25's have lasted me 14 years and still going strong."
Thanks internet historian for discovering another awesome youtuber.
"Why do people always run to buy the newest tech there is? I've bought xiaomi earphones last year, I've second pair after i last the first one. I've spend $25 on each. After a year they weren't working properly anymore so i decided to buy a nicer pair. Thankfully there are already perfectly great earpods available at a great discount and I've bought Jabras for $65. Why would anyone spend $500 on earphone's is beyond me"
Apple does and always has sold the AirPods individually. All you have to do is contact customer support and they will sell you an individual left right or even the case if you lose any individual components.
"Geeez I am so glad, I am living on the outskirts of the Apple mainstream territory...I mean tik tok children who wants recognition and cool adults, who want ""easy"" got these, but they are in no way getting more + than - looks on the contrary they are feeling little bit shy about it, not to look like snobs or are completely indeffential about they aquire of everyday technology. Just another overpriced product on the shelf. Well but then again same status was 90´s and early 2000 basicly sportwear like addidas and nike. I mean airpods seems like very very bad designed bluetooth headphones on modern markets of wireless headhones."
i found this channel randomly and watched all his shit in a day. been waiting for a new video for too long..
"I don’t know about the new headphones but the pros have good detail with decent enough sound staging especially for shallow in ear true wireless monitors. Easily worth the 200 they ask for now, now the basic airpods are utter trash and i get hate on those."
"Yknow i kinda thought airpods were really dumb but recently i fucked the charging port on my phone real bad because the earbud wire kept getting caught on everything i brushes past. 

I been borrowing my friends airpods and i gotta say, the sound quality isnt that different and i dont get the whole ""they slip out of your head easily"" thing. I do think theres a substantial advantage to bluetooth headsets and earbuds. But fuck apple"
"I have the Samsung sipped clones because I got them for free when I bought my new phone. Good thing too, I didn't realize the Z fold doesnt have a beadphone jack until weeks after buying it."
"plastic apostrophes 

i died "
I too bleached my hair in lockdown and now can't go to the barber to get it cut. Yours looks much better than mine.
AFTER GETTING STARTLED BY THE LOW BATTERY NOISE YOUR VIDEO IS A SWEET RELEIF 
"9:56
*This only applies to first world countries"
"I got a pair of AirPods free as part of the student discount Apple has, and it does have to be said that they work well, are nicely integrated into iOS, sound good and overall are decent. Would I pay $150 for them? Absolutely fucking not, not worth anywhere near that, but as a freebie, they’re alright."
"After losing a pair or air pods, one pair or pros, and giving away a third, I’ve never used these again. Sound quality sucks."
this is the best sociology class I've ever taken...
"Loving the video but I don't know what is distracting me more:
- Having a tissue on standby to remove your sweat
- Scissors for trimming the uneven mustache"
Air pods always hurt my ears to put and keep in. Never liked them
"I am not huge on airpods, but the Bose and Sony over-ear headphones you showed are worth it. My $235 Bose QC35 have been a near permanent fixture on my head for 4 years now. Easily the most used product I have outside of my phone/computer. I wear them literally 14+ hours per day on average."
"I will be quite frank. I’ve worn the WH1000-XM4 (terrible fucking name, Sony) and I think they’re better than the AirPods Max. And completely destroyed ALL of Beats offerings. And if you want Bluetooth convenience with a wired set of headphones, pick up a Fiio BTR5."
"Marketing is all very well but the AirPods sell well because they are amazing products. My day is ruined if I forget mine. The pros are in some ways better in others perhaps not, but still fantastic."
I have the courage to say that dongle is one of my favorite words
"5:10
""global corporate hegemony says trans rights"""
I got a pair of JLab airbuds 3 years ago for when I go a walk or to the gym they are great but I still use wired ones
Courage? More like because they can get away with it.
I dont own any Apple products but Ive tried airpods and they felt comfy and sound was decent. Almost bought them. I generally dont like Apple but the airpods are pretty nice.
I really didn't like wireless headphones as well but I am pretty sure you can't even find any mainstream phone maker that produces any of their new product with headphone jacks now.
"5:23
Is that an Among us reference?"
"Courage is all it takes, more money is what it makes.
holy shit so many ears filled with batteries. 
Apple has sold more than 1.4 billion pairs of earbuds over the years, making those little white pods one of the most iconic, and ubiquitous, products ever"
Laughs in wired headphones
"for me, the pods are much better to work out with, AND my ears don't fit any of the foam or rubber insert headphones, so pods are the way for me. the only way"
Great Channel. Smart and clever. Congratulations.
The absolute bullshit price tags though. It’s the definition of getting people to pay more for less. You make them expensive and people think that they’re good. BS. I got myself some wired earbuds for 1.99 at an airport and some wireless earphones for 59.99. They both have served me well for years
Apple actually will sell you one AirPod. I had a problem where one quit working after I had had them a long time and they sold me a replacement single pod. No problem.
Why didn't you talk about the crummy audio quality for the price tag? They're in the same scammy BS vein as Bose
"No wires is actually very handy, I won't go to wired headphones unless I need the best sound possible, like for making music.
Bluetooth connection on these is the best on the market (when connected to apple devices), so that argument isn't exactly valid."
"You should have also touched the sound quality topic, which for the same quality wireless headphones you pay much less, and if you are willing topay near 200 dolars for a wired earphone your ear drums should feel heaven"
Airpods = Most over priced pieces of crap since Beats
"No one's gonna mention how brilliant of a name ""you should not be allowed to serve in government if your net worth is over $2 million runrun123"" is "
"5:03 the billionth time a US citizen considered the US as the world. ""worldwide"" doesn't mean the US. It means the entire world. I know right? shocking."
"Good video. 
Only problem is the fact that minijack is a patent, and removing it and using apple own adapter with its own apple patent, all adapter sellers are going to pay apple for it. Instead of apple paying for using minijack they get paid for removing it."
"I can't begin to describe how infuriating this rush to the bottom shit with wireless headphones is as a music producer and audio engineer. Analogue audio is great! It has a wide range of compatibility and you solve all of the issues bluetooth has by just going wired. But that's not particularly the issue, I just don't buy shit from apple, simple. Problem is because corporations are fucking idiotic is that all the other manufacturers out there are following suit because apple did it. It's so bloody stupid."
This is why I use blue tooth headphones. They are impossible to lose unless you are stupid and lend them to someone are are just a forgetful person.
Watched my first video of yours tonight and I’m a big fan!
I hope when you do your irony bits it's not actually ironic
"Tbfah the cheapo Chinese clones work just as well and it's nice to move around with wireless buds instead of carrying the phone everywhere in your home. Most earpods are rechargeable and don't need frequent charges since all they do is produce sound. 

I will say though that the stock usb C samsung wired earphones are phenomenal and durable. They survived me a full deployment plus mandatory Corona extension"
"Oooh, are those some Sennheiser In-Ear Momentum headphones? If so, good choice. Their sound is second to none."
They are a tech king though
"Yeah, I'd like an explanation of how earbuds that cost hundreds of dollars are a way to ""better all of us""."
"Airpods don't even fit in 90% of people's ear's, so you could waste money on them and not even be able to use them."
I'll admit he makes some good points. But I'm not a caveman so I'll stick to wireless earbuds. Not Apple though lol I'm not stupid. I got 50 ones from Amazon that have lasted well over a year
"I agree that apple is way overhyped and anti-consumer, but man Airpods Pro are genuinely the best tech product I have bought in years and are worth every penny. Not worth the loss of the headphone jack though.

Also, just to play contrarian here, I lost one Airpod and apple replaced it for free"
How could you not mention blue tooth and brain cancer?
"I love all your shit. Well done, sir."
i love wired but after so many yanks and pulls aat work and the like i had to go wireless but i have android so it doesnt count.
"‘What we’d be staring at for the next century’

"Meme marketing is easy to spot, but impossible to prove. Pointing it out doesn't detract from the strategy, it just makes you look paranoid and bitter. It's honestly the PERFECT marketing strategy."
are we not gon talk about the thing below his eye and how airpods are enviromentaly unfriendly as you cant replace the batteries.
My best headset is a 25 year old wired Sennheiser HD 600. My problem with these wireless headsets is that they are a throwaway product. After a year or two the battery will be dead and in the landfill it goes. While if you buy one wired that you really like it will still work after years of use.
"Apple headphones have sucked since the first ipod, and not just on sound quality, they feel like shit."
"Jesus, it's like you say everything I'm thinking.

Sony's wireless over ear headphones are are just straight up better headphones than apple's. They are great for commuting on public transportation (when there isn't a pandemic) or when you live literally feet from that public transportation and your apartment is loud as fuck
Airpods aren't even comfortable to wear. Feels like jagged plastic jammed in your ear from the moment you try to put them in. I'm honestly shocked that people fork over so much for a product that isn't even convenient or comfortable.
This man talks sense. Liked the video
This was a nice and unexpected birthday gift. Cheers mate
AirPod Pros are 
"Yeah I got JBL wireless earbuds for like $60 bucks on black friday, and the quality was 10x better than airpods for like half the price."
"COURAGE?????
AH YE! I BELIEVE IN YOU APPLE GO ON TELL ME HOW BETTER IS TO NOT HAVE A HEADPHONE JACK"
The coincidences just keep lining up!
Finally someone that agrees with me that the Sony’s are nicer looking
Meanwhile me with $7 earbuds
"Single airpod replacements are $69 from apple support, $89 for the pro"
Never once owned a pair.
Already hoping for a better next year. You're clearly underselling how wild your last 3 days have been.
Joined the patreon and happy to support the cause.
Evil business of Apple when? (joking... but also not)
Youve been knocking it out of the park during covid Mate
I'm watching this with AirPods
"Also can we get some OG ordinary things opening for the start of the new year? I just rewatched the cereal episode for communion wafers cereal bit and I miss your old opening, maybe just once for the sake of nostalgia?"
"Howwww is your content getting even BETTER?? This is peak YouTube.
(btw, not sure if you take suggestions, but I'd love to see a video on Chewing Gum)"
This comment section is more of a war zone than Dunkirk in the 1940s
"Too be fair 500$ for good headphones is not that abnormal I'll admit it's a little on pricey side but still at least i think are basically within reason, and the Airpod Maxs are very high quality, some of the most open sounding closed back headphones you can buy. They are basically unrivalled in noise cancellation vs soundstage. They almost sound like open backs but I'm willing to bet most people who buy them don't give a shit about that anyways lol."
Oh how ironic to receive an airpod ad while watching this video
It would've been funnier if you were sponsored by the other wireless earbuds company.
You actually can buy a individual AirPod. It’s under the AirPods service and repair section of the website
Watching stupid people rush to get inside a store will never get old. Seriously I wish they would record it more often.
I got them for Christmas this year from Mum and I’m already being ridiculed for being rich and a snob whilst didn’t even buy them. I’m generally considering not using them and get a pair of normal earphones.
Man I can't believe Stede Bonnett hates airpods
"You should make video's on monthly payment takeovers, and how nobody buys anything up front because math is hard, and $1000 looks like more than 24 x $67... 
Also
Insurance company marketing budgets, they're so fucking massive they dont have any money left to pay your claims..."
"@Ordinary Things how about a video, talking about the development of Microtransactions? 

It all started with Horsearmor for a bethesda game AFAIK, now it ruins League of Legends and many other games. x)"
I really like my airpods though. A hated cords and carrying my phone in my pocket when walking around the house
"Apple, Dyson and One drone company I don't remember anymore were the worst companies I worked with in retail. Why? Think back to when you went into a electronics/white goods store. Lemme guess, you've already envisioned the apple table or Dyson display in the centre of the bloody store taking up all the space. This is because companies like Apple will actually refuse to sell their products to your store unless you have a big centre table for them. They essentially blackmail you into giving them the best space in the store. Second biggest thing, while the company I worked with was actually pretty rad and they gave some great prices/deals, I could not give people deals on Dyson/Apple products. This was because they only allowed a very strict profit margin mark up meaning that the cost price was only like $50-20 less than the actual retail price, meaning if we were to give it any substantial deal to a customer we would be selling it at a loss. TL;DR Apple fucking sucks, so does Dyson"
I use wireless Sony buds but they are connected by a wire just not to the phone because...I KEPT LOSING THEM. Happy balances
I’m suprised how nobody talks about when the BlueTooth only connects to ONE AIRPOD and how it literally takes 10 minutes to fix it.
"Yes, let's hope next year is better than this year. Can't wait for 2022"
imagine buying airpods 
I love your channel. So underrated 
"I like your blonde hair, it helps you stand out and suits you well."
watching this with a pair of AirPods Pro is meta...
Fairly disappointed you couldn't get a Raycon deal for this one...
AirPods are good because you can take your shirt off without pulling them out of your head.
"Well, Flash officially just died this year! Thanks, Steve!"
"me listening to this video with my airpods in, inTeresTing, anyways"
"OT: i'll see you in 2021
me: scoffs in future"
"I had to doubletake and check to make sure you weren't Philosophy Tube
 under a pseudonym. 
You both had the same voice to my ears!"
i just watched this vid and your vaping vid while vaping and listening on my airpods LMFAOO let me live
"if you like it or dont it doesnt matter wireless earphones are the future ive been using earphones with a cable all my life till last week i hated these new wireless ones but my lifes changed... i could write an essay about how much more convenient wireless earphones are ... no worn off cable which eventually stops working after couple of months, no more issues with the length of the cable, like you can workout, cook etc.. without having your phone on you or go on a run without cables hanging from your ears doenjoyingwn to your chest, no more dewiring after you stuffed em in your pocket, NO more fucking cable... just put em on and start enjoying ... yes they are pricy and yes you can loose them (like the cabled ones btw) but they are totally worth the buy if you have the money ofc"
This guys the Trap Lore Ross of consumerism
I too hope 2022 would be a better year.
Charlie Brooker should hire you as a writer
Me watching this with AirPods
I have repair of £20 Marley headphones. Sound great cheap. Put them in thr washing machine by accident and use them in all weathers as an outdoor instructor. These air pods are a waste of money in my opinion
"HE DID ITT, HE SAID THE AMOGUS WORD D:"
"I've never lost one of my AirPods. This is what the case is for. They're a great product. They connect seamlessly, transfer from device to device with ease, they charge super fast and have decent sound. And best of all, they do not break after 3 weeks like wired earphones."
So happy this came out today. I was already watching all the videos on the channel through a second time. Can't get enough! This is one of my new favorite YouTube channels. Best discovery of 2020 by far
I’m listening to this video with AirPods.
im so glad your channel is growing its so well deserved!
Mine fell in the toilet changing my shirt Knut one wrong thing in the video they do sell individual pods
I always get so excited to see when OT uploads something new to make me feel angry at the world about
"For me wireless headphones have been a great help. I currently use my Jaybird true wireless earbuds because the airport pros max are kind of a miss, especially since I switched to android. Wired headphones break wayyy to much since I skateboard and snowboard and put way too much pressure on the cables."
Am I the only person who thinks he looks like he would make a good jojo character
"This channel is destined to skyrocket past a million subs!  This is super high quality, well written, and covers great topics. Fast becoming my favorite YouTube channel!"
"I had a pair, but then, alcohol. Never again."
I thought I was the only one that missed the simplicity of corded head phones... The force is strong with Apple
"Great video as always. One of the best creators on here for sure. I also appreciate that you didn't go into defunct science that has been disproven like many other creators do with why airpods suck videos. One thing I do have issue with is you make jokes to them falling out a lot, the ONLY time I have ever had mine fall out was when I fell over myself. I have gone on hikes, runs, weight lifting, for crissakes I have even played hockey with them in my ears and they have not fallen out. I realize now as I am typing this, it could mean I have dumbo ears though if everyone else says they fall out a lot.... nah I'm right the rest of you are wrong."
7:02 Over 130?! that's so many! 
One convenient  side effect of the death of the aux port and all ports for that matter is that it removes an easy way to pirate stuff. Much easier to encrypt stuff when it travels through blutooth
I hate wireless earbuds simply because I have a coworker that's anal about seeing people listening to anything
"My 2 cents are that I've had the same AirPod model for some years now and I never had a single issue with them... not to pick a side, just my opinion. 

Do they suck? Well maybe, the price is definitely too high. But I like the variety of devices you can connect them too with the Bluetooth and the audio quality is quite good, not the best of the best but good."
"Great video! 

I'm really impressed by your community engagement. It's not often I see the creator responding to comments."
Watching this with AirPods
I literally have wireless headphones and they work great. I can also turn them into wired headphones with a removable cord. Idk why people spend so much for apple products.
All hail the great wire. STRANGLE THE COMPETITION.
"I found your channel like three days ago and I cannot stop watching your videos. They're all excellent. Full of well-researched information and your sense of humor is amazing. I love learning about random ass topics, especially ones that we don't think about much. So holy shit your channel is perfect for me. I'm sure you'll reach a million quickly. Content like this is hard to find!"
"I mean, just get wireless earphones that have a cord connecting the two earpieces. That's what I have. It's practical, wireless, and you can have them hanging from your neck when not in use."
"'Wires bad, Raycon good"""
"I think the best part about the airpod craze was that I found mine at work (a second hand store) and basically got them for 5$ of redbull to bribe the manager and about 15$ of alcoholic cleaner and peroxide. 

So while everyone was making jokes about richie yuppies and their airpods, im laughing my second hand ass off while using an iphone 5s in 2019"
"Air pods are good fpr business, cuz if they are wireless they get lost and you need to buy new ones"
"just as i finish binge watching his vids, another one shows up. Tis a blessing from the lord! Also legit your channel is really underated, i'm surprised it hasn't hit trending yet, seems prime to go alongside Oversimplified as the funny historical/educational channels."
This was a very kind video actually. I thought you’d really go into detail and rip them apart but you basically just said what everybody knows and sort of slightly made fun of “conspiracy” theorists.
"2 words ""Planned Obsolescence"" Apple customers are suckers."
Saw a patent not too long ago where Apple were looking into/testing keeping your Airpods in your ears by messing with magnetic brain waves or something similar. Spooky stuff
7:07 only 130 wireless headphones?
"I use Oppo's airdots, they cost 40$ and they sound AMAZING!!!!
They have touch screens, you can adjust the volume by holding the TS, forward or start the song again by double tapping, and answer calls with extreme ease... they have a clear sounding mic too."
"Your videos are always between sarcastic bashing of something and many information that regularly blow my mind. I really enjoy watching your videos, please never stop making them."
Me watching this with AirPods...
"I've been watching this channel all day, through my Airpods, nice to see some representation"
FINALLY SOMEBODY SAID IT
"Few weeks ago when I started binging your videos you were at 30k, and now you are at 300k+. Congrats man. Well deserved."
I can't believe how big this channel got in a month and a half!
They do sell them individually..
on the point of ease of use I really do think not having tangled headphones in your pocket is maybe being under-appreciated here (everything else I agree)
"Sure Youtube, I've just watched a video about windows guess I'll watch this too."
"I like how you hastily mentioned ""also they are cheaper"" at the end, as a reason why you prefer wired headphones."
"You’re the best creator on this platform, keep it up mate!"
I prefer my wireless headphones
Really nice video. Apple's marketing is the price tag on their over expensive products
You can get replacement single AirPods
I found your channel a week ago while I was sick as a dog and just sat in bed all day binge watching all your videos. Glad to see a new one.
Dude I also binge watched all your shows last month great content me and the wife love it!
And they casually radiate your brain all day
God yes. I've already binged every one of your videos and I'm ready for a new one thank you
Sony 1000xm4s also have a much better sound quality
I remember when I got my first tablet and found out it didn't support flash.. I was so sad. Now it's going away forever. I love flash. It would have been so awesome ti play flash games in tablets
"Easily the best to ever happen to the headphone market though, the pros are even better. Couldn't live without them."
i have never seen an airpod in my life. srsly.
doesn't surprise me that Apple users couldn't figure out wrapping your earbuds' wire around your phone while it's in your pocket to prevent tangling.
"Wires=bad
Rayon=good"
I am super happy these true wireless buds are good now. This video was a hilarious take on them
"YESSSS FINALLY, I feel like I've actually waited so long since going thru your whole catalog!"
"the only improvement is to end it with ""This video brought to you by rrrRRRAAAaaaCCOOOnnnn!!!""."
"Apple definitely sells the headphones individually. You can buy just the case, just the left or just the right. Prices are still obscene, but they do sell them individually."
Have fun buying wired headphones.
I found your channel at 70k subs like a month ago and you have absolutely rocketed since!! Very well deserved
"You know what we need? Disabling charging your phone while enjoying high quality wired audio. Yes, I only buy phones with headphones jacks. It’s a dealbreaker."
My EarPods started glitching toward the end of the video help I think they’re listening
"Watched this with my AirPods in for the lulz. Never going back to wired (at least not for when im on the go with my phone), never have battery issues unless I need to keep them in more than 4 straight hours (shockingly rare)."
I’m happy to say I’ve never and will never buy airpods. And I’m typing this comment up on a pretty damn outdated iPhone.
Always a good day when Ordinary Things uploads.
"I mainly use Skullcandy headphones, specifically the over-ear models. They have both wireless and wired support. Best of both worlds"
"Apple......a product so reliable we built repair centers all over the country.  Look down on the poor android users that have no idea what ""fixing a phone"" means."
The skull candy ones are bomb af I love mine but definitely could relate on the losing one of them absolutely pissed me off
1:30 Sounds just like the cowardly lion in the Wizard of Oz.
Speaking of courage on the part of the Apple event hosts... that moob/belly/love handles sweater-skirt over jeans at 1:22 was a bold choice for a globally-viewed exec presentation.  Someone please introduce him to structured sweaters and a sizing chart. Or at least black turtlenecks.
Extremely glad someone else feels the same way as I do. Wiregang for life!
My dad loves his air pods
Love these videos amazing editing comedy and information thx for making videos keep up the good work
i watched this with my airpods
"Much like apple, i applaud your courage to wear blue in front of a blue background"
"Jut recently discovered your channel, very funny and watchable content, thanks for your hard work!"
My wired headphones are older than this vid.  How's your 3rd pair of iPotatoes working out for you?
"yay!  glad you're back!  it's been too long with no ordinary things, and every time my little notification thing lights up, i keep hoping its new stuff from this channel....alas, nothing but disappointment until TODAY!"
wireless Behind-the-neck headphones gang rise up
i have 2 pairs of wireless headphones: one pair of on-ear headphones for my pc and one pair of airpod-esque wireless earbuds for my phone. i've come to the conclusion that the benefits of wireless headphones only outweigh the hassles when the device they're connected to doesn't fit in your pocket.
"I use the pros for work, I’m a grocery stocker so it’s practical. Anything else I either use my speakers or Bose. And also don’t get the pros they constantly lose grip and fall out."
Guess what costs like 50c to make and you buy for $800
I feel like it's fair to point out that $500 isn't particularly expensive for good headphones. And you don't need an external amplifier (easily another $700right there) or anything to use these.
I’m watching this with AirPods
I swear this channel had like 20k subs a month ago. Glad to see it is at 320k now. Dude deserves wayyy more.
"If you can prevent getting your headphones caught in a doorknob and them violently being yanked out of your ear ONCE, it's worth the investment in wireless buds."
Sorry I'd rather do self checkout than have to deal with the nonsensical bagging the cashiers do every time.
"i'm down for rating products by how strongly they bend reality in the ads. Must be a good product if it literally sends a man to space.

because in reality, air pods are always reviewed as a resounding ""eh, they're okay sounding buds, i guess if you really like apple there's worse things you could buy"" or something along those lines"
I just lost my right headphone ️
"charging has never been a problem for me, since they charge fully in like 10 minutes if the case is charged, and the case charge usually last me about a week. also never once had them fall out. plus, the $20 wired headphones i used to buy would be no good after about 2 months, while these airpods have lasted me like 3 years. worth it to me, idk"
"I've tried buying wireless headphones once. They were supposed to be quality, much cheaper than airpods, but still. See, I (might) have slight Tinnitus and I am a very paranoid person sometimes who can't stand too much noise, so when I listen to anything really, I tend to listen to it at the lowest/second lowest volume (I want to keep my hearing thank you very much).
So I bought them and tried using them later at home. Wireless headphones are not designed for this. You are supposed to listen to the music at a higher volume, otherwise you can hear the disturbances that are the result of them being wireless. The light buzz I could hear no matter what I did was unbearable. I use music to distract myself from the constant buzzing in my head, so when the headphones were only adding to that, I just couldn't focus on the music itself. When I came bact to the store to return them, the person in charge of that tried them. According to him, they were fine, but he literally put the music on the highest volume imaginable, even I could hear it from 2 metres away. Thankfully I managed to return them, but still."
Hey this guy's pretty funny
This guy is too underrated for his humor and effort
"Just buy cheaper Bluetooth earphones, like £50 or something, I don’t understand why ppl HAVE to buy AirPods specifically, I just don’t get it"
7:02 yes. I’d assume at least 130 pairs were sold in a year or so.
"I'm surprised you didn't mention how painful they are to wear, at least for me, based on my experience with the wired earbuds that come with their products sometime the design of them are just a hunk of plastic that hurts your ears."
They’re good plastic apostrophes
this is really well done! <3
iPhones still have headphone jacks.. you just have to drill a small hole to get to it.
"Okay, this entire video was basicallyjust ""I don't have any argument against AirPods other than they are expensive, but I don't like them"" lol. There's nothing wrong with wireless headphones, most of the time they work perfectly fine and I think my wired headphones fail more often due to tangling cables."
"Most of these issues aren’t AirPod specific... they apply to most Bluetooth earbuds. My AirPods are good for what they are, and I have been using them as well as other cheap, small Bluetooth earbuds for years. I wouldn’t want to go back to any wired headphones again."
In sweden the dongle cost 12 euros
Surprised this didn't get into the actual audio quality vs a $170 pair of headphones by a real audio company.
Lol I actually own those Sonys.
"literally the funniest channel i’ve come across, best thing 2020 brought me was this channel"
Jamming sound devices into your ear to blast waves directly into your head has always been baffling to me. I've only ever held other people's headphones/ear speakers a fair distance away from my ear and used external speakers.
How exactly are airpods more of a crime against the head than wired earbuds? Stick by ur title
"Told my mum my normal earbuds broke so she said she'd buy me new ones for Xmas. She bought me wireless ones. Well intentioned, I'm sure, but as soon as the holidays passed and I got home I just went and ordered a pair of the wired $10 ones off Amazon, for when I inevitably lose the wireless ones/need to use them while they're not charged. I can barely remember to charge my phone, I can't deal with another responsibility in my life... They're an objectively worse product, more expensive, and people still buy them, I don't get it!"
just buy normal wireless headphones for £10 lol
Personally I find wireless headphones a lot more convenient than wired ones. They’re easier to use on the go and in the gym. I really don’t get the hate for wireless headphones.
"Just finished binging all of ur videos a few days ago, love ur content man keep it up! :D"
130 wireless headphones were sold worldwide
"Lol I’m one of them. Now I love most of Apple’s tech because their phones and watches do compete with other products but I will NEVER EVER bend to buy apple’s over priced and mediocre earbuds regardless how much I love Apple. I’ve had Sony’s wi‑sp600n sports headphones and they are among the best tech items I’ve ever invested on. You can see them on my picture lol. Had them for 2 years now, great sound quality, great battery, noise canceling, comfortable on my little ears and affordable."
I love the way you hate everything. You are the best hater <3
"I’m not a big fan of apple in general but I’ll straight up admit that my AirPods are great. I’ve tried practically every brand or type of wireless earbuds and genuinely nothing beat them. They don’t fall out of my ears as much, they’re way more comfortable, sound better, and have a longer lasting battery with a super short charge time. I’ve never lost them nor do I know anyone who has lost theirs, it’s a lot harder to misplace or forget them than you’d expect. It does cost more from the environment than is gained by their sale, but if you’re not deliberately trying to ruin them you’ll be set on headphones/earbuds pretty much forever. Rip to all the old wired headphones lost to my cat"
"10k views in 28 minutes??
Well this video is the most hilarious yet so yeh well deserved
Love how you finished the video with the one argument that just might get everyone to stop buying; 'everyone's buying them' xd"
Why dont they have the courage to switch to usb c?
"Quality vid as always, great start to the new year"
"I like my airpoda, but i hate that my iphone doesn’t have headphone holes. Its disgusting"
i cant believe they managed to sell over 130 wireless headphones
"7:02 Holy crap, they sold over 130 individual wireless headphones? That’s enough for an entire rural middle school!"
me watching this with airpods
this has become my favorite yt channel in the past few months
"Bring back the headphone jack

Please apple I might buy your phone
Maybe"
"I was a big wireless audio hater for a long time, dragging a pair of Sennheiser HD 650s to school. I still use wires for sound quality, but the ability to walk to the kitchen and not bring my phone makes the AirPod pros worth it to me"
"You can't rush perfection, but I sure wish you uploaded more often"
I watched this with AirPods
You know things are going well when you can causally throw airpods down the toilet for a gag!
"My Samsung S7 still works great, wireless earbuds are stupid and Apple is a fucking cult. I like my money to remain in my hands thank you. That does not make me poor, just financially responsible."
The one good thing yt recommended has done. Great video mate! Subbed
"I miss when I could just plug head phones in.. 

I didn’t think headphones ever needed to be wireless"
I hate apple and almost everything they made/stole from other companies but this ? This was good. I never had and never will buy their products I just waited and now tomorrow I'm receiving my many years later made Chinese copy that has even more features than the ones apple make.
Ultimately (at the end of this video) we will come to the conclusion that this is the way things are now and there is nothing we can do.
Me watching this w my AirPods on 
"Dang your channel really blew up! Good job man, love ur content"
"I like the fact I can’t tell if you’re stoned or just shit tired, but I love. 

Also, Hard Seltzer is a government conspiracy."
I'll buy it anyways.
I bought a nice pair of ENACFIRE wireless earbuds last year and the best thing about them is they actually fit inside my ears! Now I can listen to music while I'm working without worrying about my phone being damaged. The future is now! Yay!
I also have a giant air pod speaker
"Thank you for making my birthday even better without meaning to! This is fantastic, especially considering you are the favourite."
i too started binge watching Ordinary Things until I realized this was a recent video and not an old one-
"When you buy a new Samsung phone, they give you thair wireless ear buds as a gift. Apple sucks!"
"Ordinary Things started this entire pandemic while working at an Apple import warehouse, secretly contaminating earphones... just to cause me to find, then subscribe to his channel! But most of all he did it to discover the true identity of the Internet Historian via ""collaboration"", I for one have to applaud his terroristic capitalism because America!"
ill never buy an apple product for the following reason: i dont want to be stuck in one sole ecosystem. if apple makes a shit phone id either have to keep buying their phones (as to not lose all the payments on the app store/ usefullness of the airpods/apple watch) OR i step away from apple and i lose a shit ton of money
"Love your channel, keep it up!"
Keep the content coming :) happy new year
"I love your allusions, guy"
I am so anti-Apple but i just want to correct that you CAN get a replacement AirPod if you call support. They're like 70 bucks.
"i mean... you never really specified why it's bad. Maybe you don't like wireless because you'll lose them, but I, and a lot of people, bought my first pair of wireless headphones (the sony over-ear ones) several years ago and cannot go back to not being able to travel 2 feet from my device without turning the music off first. And yeah, they're expensive. Everything Apple is expensive. So what? It's the brand. If you can't afford Apple then buy any number of other wireless headphone brands. Or just use wires."
"I use wireless headphones but nice big, base boosting dj styled headphones. Easy to keep track of, long battery life but more importantly very durable. Plus if the batteriea do run out aux cables can still keep me grounded.

Ive tried raycons (twice). The first i lost one ear, the secind i got for a present only for one ear to just stop working 3 weeks later. To me large wireleas headphones is thr perfect blend of form and function"
Kinda disappointed by the lack of mentions that AirPods break down more often than a paranoid schizophrenic PTSD WWII vet. Worked Apple customer support for about 3 months. About 25% of calls we received were AirPods malfunctioning.
6:56 really getting some upisnotjump vibes now.
I absolutely love my air pods ️
I never owned an apple product and never will..
Love your videos. Really amazing job mate!
Ayy you’re back! My dude. I feel like your channel blew up like crazy lately
Apple sells individual AirPods
The last time I used headphones was on the bus as a teen. I like to hear the world around me when walking through it call me old fashion
But you can buy just one airpod. You don't have to buy a whole new set
"I've never had the inclination to even consider purchasing Air Pods. They probably sound like shit just like Beats, and they probably fall out every 25 seconds. All for only $150! I wear $15 letscom ear buds. They sound great and they are the kind with rubber ends that go into your ear so they NEVER fall out. They are bluetooth with the wire that connects the left and right ear bud."
"Also, airpods are too small to make it worth it to recycle if you try to put them in electronics recycling. Eventually, every airpod ever purchased will either be lost or in a landfill."
"I also hate that there also latency with BT headphones, but that is just BT"
Thanks for keeping it real
"Jo apple actually DOES sell airpods individually. It’s on their bloody support site.
It’s just like that right to repair nonesense: iPhones and macbooks are Made to be repaired. That’s why there are apple stores all around the world. Why doesn’t everyone get parts from apple ? Because the logistics behind that would cost billions and would make those parts so darn expensive, the “small independent” shops would get even angrier. Eventhough you can just go through the proper training and get apple certified."
As an athlete air pods have been a great addition to my workout
This is the most 1st world thing I’ve ever seen. And I love it.
"I wanted so badly to wipe your fukkin' eye for you this whole video...
but also a great rant!."
I absolutely adore your content man its quality and personality like no other
i watched this video on my iphone with my airpods....
7:03 130 wireless headphones sold worldwide? Incredible
YES MORE ORDINARY THINGS TO LEARN ABOUT!
Yeah I refuse to buy AirPods on principal but I do mainly use wireless headphones anymore. I just don’t like running or working out while dealing with the damn wires. I just fucking hate wires and I’m satisfied with buying $20 wireless headphones.
"The thing I really hate about the apple airpods is that they didn't think about the people who have smaller ears (like me).
After like an hour of having them in my ears it already hurts like hell and it's annoying."
I can't wait for Apple buttplug or iplug ohhhh gonna buy that sucker xD its gonna be my only Apple product but its gonna be worth
"The last insight about the price, I'll keep that in mind going forward."
"8:18
""Conspiracy things"" is my new favorite character in the Ordinary EU"
Watched this with AirPods in
I might be a crazy person but isn't having 2 wireless signals on either side of your brain for prolonged periods of time everyday going to have an undesirable effect eventually?
"7:03 
one hundred and thirty! i honestly think you're jumping the gun abit"
Keep up the good work sir!
"apple recently did a promotion here where students got a free pair of AirPods if they bought one of the iPads they were clearing out old stock of for school. In other words, a bunch of students got AirPods, so a bunch more are going to feel worse without them."
5:25 AHHHHHH GET OUT OF MY HEAD
you actually can buy the earbuds separately if you lose one.
I used to enjoy punching people who wore Google Glass.  But now there are so many airpod users the punching of the wearers is pointless.
keep up the good work mate!
Just found this channel and it’s soooo underrated
No audio jack is the reason i will not get a new iphone
"If you're going to spend your money on expensive headphones, at least get ones that don't easily fall out your ears and have better sound quality. Bose QC35s. They're great. Try them."
"If only there were a superior alternative to apple products.
Can't think of anydroids."
Your going to hit a million subs by July! Keep doing what your doing bro your amazing
"recently subbed and clicked this video so fast, can't wait for more!"
i fw me airpod 2’s they lit!
"What otherdimensional entity did you sell your Happiness to in order to come out the Gate with super hot FIYAH content from Video 1? No floundering early age. No awkward regrettable haircuts, greasy faced skits that go on a half hour too long 

What even are you, mate? 10/10"
"How do apple products still sell, Jesus."
I just don't understand why people would want the look of old style apple earbuds with the wire snipped off instead of the sleekness of any other bluetooth earbuds that sit snuggly in your ear.
Ordinary Things only get more sinister with each installation.
Listening to this video with AirPods
I'm perfectly content with my wired Sennheisers
"AirPods are pretty great tbh, I like your videos but you literally hate on everything I like"
The thing I hate is in-ear headphones. They're uncomfortable. The rubber bits fall off and get lost easily. I just want some cheapo headphones I can lose and not worry about. It's getting quite hard to find regular earbuds in shops.
"I made a jokey comment already but I also wanted to say that this was a really cool and fun video to watch, your content is really awesome "
"You can get better wireless earbuds for less than a quarter of the price of airpods. The only justifiable reason to buy airpods is to look rich. (well, rich and stupid.)"
"Airpods are decent Bluetooth earbuds, but they are WAY too overpriced for what they do, id rather price it at like $20, $30 instead of $100"
3:44 Was that a downward spiral I saw???
Love your videos keep up the great work
I feel like you just popped outa no where and now Im thinking you are on of my favorite Youtubers
8 bones for a freaking dongle I spent £130 on one
favorite new channel. I've watched your entire backlog already
This video should be sponsored by Raycon
"As much as I don't like wireless earphones, I hate when one of the earphones would stop working after a couple of weeks because of the wire. The longest any headphones lasted for me was about 2 years when I lost them. After that I was lucky if even 1 side was still working after a couple of months. My current wireless ones have been going strong for a month but I am always scared they will fall out."
This sounded excellent through my Raycons
":""trending worldwide""
:it says america"
you're my new favourite YouTuber. great video!
"if you can buy a Sony, a JBL a Marshall a Bose a Koss (that offers lifetime warranty) for the fraction of the price, why would you buy an Apple product that is clearly inferior??"
A true beacon of Hope in the dark sludge of this transitional dystopian period of humanity. Gawd Blesss
"Not exactly a balanced view here. Phones without dedicated headphone jacks in general offer some benefits, larger batteries, better waterproofing, better longevity (less mechanical stress). For those exact same reasons it is not unlikely that we will see a port-less phone in the next 5 years, with the prevalence of wireless headphones and charging now. Airpods are very much another romantic vain product by Apple, brought in to create this culture and potential benefit  It's not particularly courageous, it's their tried and tested business model, I don't personally like the airpods, but they're part of a undeniable trend towards wireless first."
Buying an Apple product is peak lameness
Love your videos. That's all I got.
The airpods have great bass but beside that they are god awful. I'm glad I stole em.
So happy to see a new video from you in my sub box. Thank you
This man blew up so quick
"I think wires are so superior, why tf do I care if I don’t have a cord for an extra 100 dollars."
Mate your content: impeccable
7:03 Wow over 130. That's pretty good
Why not just use sport-style Bluetooth ear buds? Best of both worlds.
Ordinary Conspiracies is a good side character/b plot
People deserve every once of shit they get from Apple if they but the products
"""over 130 wireless headphones were sold world wide""... He's not wrong."
My cord always breaks
"Another solid video, not sure why seeing you hit yourself with a giant airpod is so funny"
Fun fact: When Steve Jobs worked at Atari he apparently smelled so bad all the time that his coworkers were grateful he opted to work by himself overnight.
"I own a pair of aliexpress wierd brand wireless earbuds and there better then all big brands LOL! and that for only 15,-"
New to this channel but can't stop watching
"I do have 3 non Apple EarBuds which I use never.
They sound bad and as already sayd bluetooth is trash!!!"
These vids are great!
"I recently bought a cheap pair of KZ IEMs, they sound miles better than any wireless earbuds currently on offer"
"""This video is sponsored by Raycon"""
I find it funny how Apple’s phones post iPhone 7 are designed to punish people for the sin of not wanting to pay hundreds of dollars for easily-losable earbuds.
"Apple's a luxury brand. Nothing more, nothing less. Their marketing team is maybe the single best on the market right now, and they keep on capitalizing on people's need of showing they arent poor. How can I be poor, I own an airpod max? But dont ask me how I paid for it.
It honestly baffles me that some people have actually taken a loan to buy headphones. It just shows how strong peer pressure is."
Nice Pynchon collection. I'm sure he's exerted no influence at all.
The most personal video he has ever made
"repeat after me: nuclear.
it's not nu-que-le-ar"
I watched a shit ton of your videos last night and subscribed this morning wondering when you'd upload.
Were dose someone get a massive airpod?
Another video to put on repeat daily
The youtube algorithm is loving you right now - as am I 
"His hair is airpods.

Just don't do it!"
"I will stick to over-heads as long as possible:

-The sound's better
-Less hearing-issues"
WIRES BAD! AIRPOD GOOD!!
Courage = Forcing people into buying a product made with slave labor and marked up to the extreme
Outstanding stuff.
"Come on, people. Headphones or bust. And who on the planet wants an extra thing to remember to charge every day? They are specifically designed to be lost so you have to buy new ones. Only a gullible, naive idiot would think otherwise.
Also you can't get quality sound from a device that small. Maybe ""okay"" sound, but that's it. Just buy a foldable pair of headphones. They're everywhere and cost $20. Problem solved."
"Man, you totally missed the opportunity to swim in good old Raycon sponsorship money"
This is quality
"Yay, new content. Yaaaaay!"
was just watching some of your videos and realized you uploaded. god is good.
Music just isn't important enough to me to worry about paying for any of this nonsense.  Also I'm not a twat.
After that sneaky Deadly Unna reference I'm convinced you went to school in Australia somehow
I feel very attacked by this video
What a great guy
I don't hate Apple anymore but I don't buy their products as hate takes way too much energy. I don't like being brand-loyal. Imagine being die-on-hill loyal to a mutli billion (trillion!?) dollar company and thinking that is somehow rewarding and worth it.
Airpods dont deserve to touch my mp3 player
"Funny, I've had airpods since they were released and I've never lost them. They're an amazing product"
you know whats a real crime? THE MIDROLL ADS
"The airpods are the only wireless earbud I can personally use, in-ears don’t fit/stay in my tiny, misshapen earholes but the airpod/apple earbud shape fits in perfectly and doesn’t fall out. I still use my wired apple earbuds but the airpods are good for the gym or for running. Anything where the cord can accidentally snag on something, the airpods are great for it. I also like them for when I’m cooking, I just put a video on and leave my device on the table and I’m free to move around the kitchen. I even watched this video with my airpods in my ears. Yeah they’re fucking expensive though."
He speaks the truth
I feel very attacked by this video
"the pros are the only ones that actually add something. the originals are just earbuds without the wires, and the Max's are just the pros without a real case. bruh"
"Ironic
I got an airpod commercial during this video"
"Are there actually people who like ska on the internet still? 

The bastards will never keep us down ~"
"FINALLY!
A VIDEO!"
"Not the right vid but i watched a bunch of videos being like why did he dye his hair blonde, and kind of badly then finally watched the mcdonalds video recently and all made sense in the world for a moment"
I've been waiting for this
Listened to this with airpods
DO A VIDEO ON IN-LINE SKATES !
Ayyyy that’s one of my favorite songs from Undertale! A real man of culture.
I like headphone jacks.
"I still haven’t converted to air pods. The idea of charging my head phones feels asinine. How’s that for a courageous statement, Fapple?"
I watched this video using airpods
"Hell yeah, new upload!"
"Freezer drawered founder. Wow, that's probably gonna be well overlooked, but damn, that's funny"
"One of my pet hates is people reffering to any other brand of wireless earbuds as 'fake airpods'. This has never happened to me, but I know, one day it will, aand I will be annoyed"
"I don't know man. Personally I believe that most of these people that are against wireless buds/headsets are just too stubborn to give it a shot. I was too, but I bought some cheap but not too cheap buds from AliExpress, I thoroughly enjoyed them, then I got me some Galaxy buds plus and have enjoyed it a lot! Tried my wired earphones a few weeks ago and it was god awful to untangle the wires, the weight of the wires pulling on them and then hearing all the scraping noises of the cable coming through the earphones, just all in all an unpleasant experience compared to quickly popping out a bud or two and having a great sound experience, because they absolutely don't sound bad despite their size! If anyone hasn't tried it, I recommend to purchase some 20-30$ ones from AliExpress and giving it a shot."
Are you really trying to rip on TWS headphones? Cause you try going to a run with wired headphones and listen to them flapping around.
Cultference. Amazing.
"It's weird, I've boycotted apple my whole life, so much so Ive stopped buying apples at the store, must be a subconscious thing. I love apples"
5:25 AMONGUS 
I hate capitalism. It's stripped us of almost all of our humanity to the point where we don't even understand or value our own instincts. But damn do I love my airpods. They were a gift and I can listen to my Das Kapital audiobook while jogging around my upper middle class neighborhood 
What's the difference between £150 airpods and some cheep AliExpress knock off ones?? £145 
Your hair looks awesome!
"If you want wireless earbuds but don't care about the P R E S T I G E and also don't hate people, there's a pair for no more than $30 on Amazon. Wear them one at a time and BOOM, you're still a functioning human being who is also discretely listening to music. Best of both worlds."
6:51 Looks like the thing from Persona 3
"I have fake AirPods that are superior. They cost around 20 USD, the change lasts very long, the charging case can recharge the pods like 15 times before needing to be recharged, and they’re purple because white pods are eh. I also only wear one pod at a time because they hurt my ears if I use both even at lowest volume so I save even more charge"
I love mine lol
They do sell them separately. Why wasn’t this suggested by a store rep?
Our host here is an indelible slice of man.  I'm not saying I'm into men but if he had an onlyfans I'd see how much it cost.
Me who bought airpods two days ago..
Love the Fable music
laughs in detachable aux
"This is the first time I've actually been interested in following a youtube channel in months, keep making great videos"
AirPods Pro’s are pretty good and pretty cheap these days compared to the competition.
Dropped mine in the toilet 
One of the best channels on YouTube!
What’d he mean by Kool-Aid Chuggers?
OMAIGAAAAD I've literally just finished watching all your videos hahah
You should reach out & see if Raycons will sponsor you they're better & cheaper than Apple ️
"Man, 130, that's a lot "
"Welp. While I’m here, are there any good cheap alternatives to AirPods? I legit need new head phones and I’m not gonna lie, I’ll blow up another Tennessee RV before I give Steve Jobs’ rotting market corpse any more money.(ignore the off color jokes this is actually a serious inquiry)"
Watched this with airpods
Finnaly a new video :)
"Love this channel and basically everything you've done but I can't really agree with some of these criticisms.

First, I've never had an issue losing my airpods, clumsy people can lose anything. The airpods strap, while I cannot deny they seem to have a lot of reviews, I've personally never seen one in my life and wasn't even aware of their existence, so it can't be that big of a problem. I also can't believe connection issues are an (albeit brief) criticsm, this is one area where they literally beat every other true wireless earbud hands down, even when connected to non-Apple devices. And noise cancelling is a criticism really, when Bose have been doing it for years prior? Your argument about cutting people out is valid but it is peoples choice, so I don't think that can be used as a criticism of the product especially when so many others do the same. You haven't mentioned that they have a mode to let more speech-frequency sound through the noise-cancelling mics either, actually letting you hear people as clearly as if you weren't wearing them too... maybe because it takes away from the point you were trying to make?"
"the best marketing, you can't even see..."
"If you're sticking with wires, why not go all out? Get a corded phone as well."
"I'm still trying to figure out the point of this video, other than the fact that you want to live in 2015"
I know that Apple are not really any worse than most of their competitors but there's just something so smug about it's Image and there spokespeople remind me more of T.V evangelists than business people trying to sell me something. I know Samsung and  Sony are after the contents of my wallet just the same but at least they seem somewhat aware that they're selling me a  consumer products not revolutionising my whole life.
"I will never understand the point of this video, do you have arthritis that its difficult for you to keep the airpods back into the charging case? A literal child could do it with ease. I'm not even an apple fanboy, the only apple product I own is the iPhone, I listen to my music on 350$ IEMs (moondrop blessing 2) and do my computing on a gaming pc but even I cannot discount the convenience of the airpods, if I didn't care too much about sound quality, I wouldn't have moved on from my airpods that I had been using for the past 3 years. All the criticisms you present are kinda pointless IMO."
"Apple can take their exclusivity and stick it where the sun don't shine, because I'm not buying their products. Also where did you even get that oversized AirPod?"
"I prefer wired headphones, the problem is my dad buys a lot of Apple Products, including a pair of AirPods for me, so every time I want to wear my normal headphones just so I can listen to what’s going on around me better or the AirPods are charging, my dad always asks “WhY aReN’t YoU uSiNg YoUr AiRpOdS?” Idk, maybe cause it’s cause I don’t want to accidentally loose them and I actually like wired stuff"
lmfao airpods.
YES I WAS WAITING FOR A NEW VIDEO
"The original Airpods suck but the AirPod Pros are actually pretty good in terms of sound quality and features. However, I agree that wired IEMs (in earbuds) are way more reliable because they don't have a battery that will eventually die, and the IEMs I daily drive (Moondrop Aria's) even have a replaceable cable so when the cable breaks, it's only like 10$ to replace."
I watched this in AirPods
"I do like wireless headphones, but AirPods are some of the worst, especially compared to the fact that Samsung sells something that's now $50 cheaper, actually stays in your ear, and stays on for more than 5 hours. It might be worth it for the convenience you have an actual iPhone, but otherwise there's not much reason to buy it. It's not that all things without wires are bad, it's just that the AirPods aren't good; but they set the precedent that wireless earbuds aren't good at all. "
Cultference is a good one
I'm like 5 minutes in and if this doesn't end with a raycon ad I will be bitterly surprised
Surprised this wasn’t sponsored by Raycons
5:00 I wonder what happened to PJ Tucker that day
All the criticisms you have apply to any true-wireless headphones and are kind of just common sense anyway. Just senseless Apple-bashing.
I’m on my 3rd set if airpods
I've never been so excited
"My biggest problem is being called POOR for using non apple products that actually cost more to produce and aren't blown up in cost for gross profit, brand recognition, and advertisement campaigns."
i think that if you actually tried using airpods for a while you wouldn't think of most of the stuff u said in the video. i thought they're dumb for a long time but im actually the dumb mofo that's been using them for the last year.
"The courage to charge people more $$$ and not let them fix their own stuff. Get an Android phone. Do ""gamer headsets"" next they break in exactly the same place every time and it is ""product damage"" and not a manufacturing defect. Bullshit it isn't! They were designed that way. I did get 300 hours use out of a headset for work at home in 2 months. I have to wear headphones when I am out walking or I 100% will be told my sexuality from passing cars, thanks a lot mum!"
AIRPODS GOOD WIRES BAD
"Headphones are one thing I will actually spend decent money on. I really love podcasts and music, so I figured the expense was worth it. Cheap ones burn out quickly so investing in good ones is a good idea. But these airpods are such a joke. They know their customer base is stupid and just wants to be associated with a brand, rather than buying a good product. My Bluetooth constantly disconnects from my car, god only knows how annoyed I'd be having to connect to g'damn headphones."
"I actually prefer Raycons and I love them. I usually use them when I’m at the gym or I’m at home playing Minecraft. The sound quality is just as amazing as all the other top name brands and they’re half the price. The ones I’m using are the everyday E25’s. They’re the best ones yet. 6 hours of playtime, seamless Bluetooth pairing, more bass, available in multiple colors, and their compact design helps get rid of background noise. I also like the fact that you can click either earbud with your finger to pause your music. Makes it super convenient if you need to stop for any reason."
Horrible take. Wireless headphones are the same price and much more convenient.
I feel like British accents lend the speaker a sense of authority and intelligence. The opposite is true of an American southern accent. You could prattle on about quantum physics and if you're doing so in a southern accent it will sound like the words of an idiot.
One of the main points wasn't discussed here.. Apple ear and airpods are terribly uncomfortable and doesn't stay in the ear well. I haven't tried airpods pro though but ergonomics of the rest are garbage. Galaxy buds are so much better. Also their shape promotes ear wax buildup if you use them a lot.
"I don't buy Apple. In 2022, they've completely letgo on privacy and security concers they used to be known for. They repurpose old tech with a new minor feature and upsell it at twice the cost when a new iPhone comes out as well. That's not whay I'm commenting. Ever since this ""courage"", other companies either downgrade the decoder chip in the aux jack (to make you get wireless buds; my Samsung a11's have this problem) or remove aux completely. I write music, so I own a $200 professional set of on-ears and because of my phone decoder chip being horrible, I have to suffer with a reduction in audio quality when I'm on the go. The headphones sound crisp and amazing on any other device, but on my phone, they sound like crap. There is no ""courage"" in what Apple and other companies do in 2022 regarding the aux component."
I miss the old theme music
Magnificent
Sony is kinda like you know better though. I don't get why you'd get the airpods max. They have a case that doesnt even protect it and it can't turn off...It's basically just a purse with nothing in it that you carry around and can use to listen to music with
As I wear my airpods pro and watch on my iphone
My 100 euro wireless headphones are better. Cheaper and last longer ( almost a week without charging and lots of use)
"You should do an ""Evil business of Apple""
From slave manufacturing to their humble beginnings as a thief."
Better alternative- neckband
"As an introvert. I love my airpod pros at work. I really don’t care what others are saying or doing. “Leave me alone, and leave me out of it” is my motto. As well as it has transparency mode to hear people while they’re in."
Hey. Hey what do wireless headphones have that wired ones don’t?
I like the wireless in ear headphones that have a wire between them. Feels like the best of both worlds
"Trap Lore Ross, best Patreon supporter."
9:45 he says as im watching a video with sony wireless headphones
Almost 100 comments in 5 minutes. This channel is definitely the underrated.
I couldn't hear this video I'm still using my wires
"as a brit. why do any british you tubers that find a shrewd of fame, insist on dying their hair bleach blonde"
"I know its fun to hate on apple and all, but don't any of you realise that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of other brands of (often much cheaper) bluetooth head phones you can buy? Even if you have an iphone, there's no reason whatsoever to buy any of apple's overpriced accessories.  People seem to think that if you buy an apple product, you're locked into buying only overpriced apple accessories, as though there isn't a massive array of 3rd party accessories available."
why did you buy a pair for yourself in the first place?
"Sorry, but don’t agree on that one. I really prefer airpods over wired ones.
1. I had issue with wired one for years, when the wires got broken somewhere and one of the earbuds stopped working. I was buying earphones like 2 per year"
This video didn’t age well
I love my AirPods…they don’t hurt my frankly tiny ears that cannot comfortably wear cooler niche brands and wires are somewhat bothersome. And I haven’t yet lost one a year in. I can also wear them at work without people thinking I’m slacking off:)
"Anyone who’s used AirPods knows that they’re waaaay more practical. They last for over four hours, great sound quality and the wires don’t get in your way (literal lifesaver in the gym). The joke is, I’ve saved money over the three years that I’ve had them, as I was spending money on wired earphones all the time."
I never got the hype behind airpods in fact I hate people that use them anytime I go talk to them.
JLab makes way better products for way cheaper.
This guy is my favorite Russell Brand.
You forgot that they’re a superior sound quality as well
"Gotta say most of these complaints seem pretty silly. Have had AirPods for about two years, wear them a lot, have never lost one. When someone is talking to me I can just grab one of the EarPods, you don’t have to fumble with the case. You can even just pause what you’re listening to and leave it in. I never have battery issues because I almost always have one bud in and one charging, which conveniently also allows me to talk to people without fumbling with the case (seriously what even is that complaint).  I will admit I wish they didn’t get rid of the aux that that was ridiculous to remove functionality like that. I never thought I wanted AirPods then (funnily enough) I got them for Christmas in 2019 and have really loved them since."
jobs was right about flash
I love Apple! Treats their customers like shit and customers still buy. Activision Blizzard learned from the best!
7:04 wow 130!! That’s like more than 129
can't stop looking at how green the sides of your face are
"Regarding the AirPod pro max, I highly recommend watching DankPods video on them. There are subtle details which make them worth $500"
"I don't need another fucking thing to charge. Especially when $20 dollar earbuds have gotten way better than they have any right to be recently. The power of chinese factory work, for $20 or $200 ear nerds, you decide."
"Ok... as an Android user who got a pair of air pod pros as a gift. They are honestly just pretty solid earbuds. What i find crazy though, is that they don't even come with a proper fucking charger. The charger it comes with is USB c to ""Apple port"". Like. WTF? what was i supposed to plug that into. My phone? Anyways, the point is. I had to go out and buy a fucking USB to ""Apple port"" wire separately. Which like, come on bro, these things cost like what? 200 bucks? At least give me a fucking charger that practical."
Replace courage with money and thsts the reason they did it
"The worst Apple fans are the ones who get off on the exclusivity and act like people who don't buy Apple products are poor because ""they can't afford Apple"", like as if there's no other reason to buy another phone over an iPhone other than the price"
"Sales are steadily going strong and Apple ret... customers are buying them and it will probably double this year. Expect absolutely no change.
Note: Wearing headphones or pods all day is a great way to get impacted cerumen. You don't know how bad this is until you have to get it syringed the fuck out."
There is music from Harry Potter in this I’m sure of it
"I got many reasons why airpods are better than the cheap knockoff 3rd party wireless buds- my Airpod pros last about 6 hours and can fully charge in about 12 minutes in the case, the case itself is well-made and feels quality as it’s magnetic and not made of awful plastic like all the cheaper brands, also they stay in my ears and have NEVER fallen out in the year plus I’ve had them, they aren’t audiophile quality but they have solid mids and noise cancelation including spatial audio which sounds 3D and amazing. I have no complaints with my airpods just stop being cheap and get them instead of trying to prove something by getting cheapos"
Tools of apple
"this shit perpetuates inequality. Of course airpods are a luxury item. apple's campaign to get rid of a headphone jack entirely is completely damaging the market. You can barely find a smartphone with a headphone jack anymore, meaning everything you use with it has to be upgraded for you to be able to use it. I dont want to replace the radio system in my car or buy a new expensive ass vehicle just so I can listen to music in the car. I dont want to buy 150$ headphones that hurt my ears and are uncomfortable as shit and easy to lose just because of apple's 'courage' to move on. what the hell."
I thought you would talk about the health issues of having a bluetooth receiver on each side of your brainz
"For any wondering, the music at 4:50 is: le carnaval des animaux: aquarium"
"Blessings
Romans 8:1-2 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death./inspiration+Since the crucifixion, Christ in a sense eradicated death and sin. Dying on the cross, we learnt that his sacrifice washed our sins away, clearing the debt, not only for the past, but also the future. Whilst death had no lasting dominion over men thanks to the resurrection, to the afterlife all God’s children can expect to enter into, rejoicing in the name Jesus. /prayer+ God my Heavenly Father, heavy is the debt we owe to you and thy Son, who paid for our sin with his blood, and who gave us hope in salvation. Praise be in Christ who showed us your word made flesh, and the flesh made holy. In my faith I shall fear no death, for it only serves to bring me closer to your love and grace wherein I may rest in joy and peace, in your loving embrace. Amen."
I had AirPods Pro’s but cannot find them
"(Apple DO sell individual replacements) 
(More expensive, of course, but you still get to use the one set you still have)"
"Why overpay for Apple products when you could just overpay for their competitor's better thought out products?

Courage."
Looking like the vault dweller in this episode
"Just commenting to help this channel get as big as it deserves. Hear my prayer, mighty Algorithm!"
watches this with airpods
"I mean, they were right about removing the jack, everyone else did too afterward, and now we have affordable Bluetooth alternatives. For 99% of people the audio quality is unchanged, and for the last 1%, you shouldn't be listening to music on your phone if you want audiophile quality anyways."
"personally, all the wired hearphones I used before the airpods served me  like 4-6 months at best. A pair of airpods is good for a year+. I actually enjoy not having a wire dangling around anymore. I've never lost a pair either. The fact that you can't use two airpods from different sets and replace a battery is v scammy tho"
More conspiracy jokes
All I know is when I’m in a sticky situation I only need 5 words to be said out loud. “Hey Siri Call the police” 
nearly six hundo for apple phones :DD lol
"Apple is a shitty company, but I honestly feel like the base model Airpods are some of the best wireless headphones on the market, to this day. I bought a pair when they came out and then switched to Android shortly after. I tried a handful of android specific wireless headphones and none of them were as convenient or comfortable as airpods, even with half of their features not working on Android."
"I have always been a bluetooth-headphone type guy. No losing one ear, comfy to wear, and great noise canceling. Plus, if you are antisocial like me, nothing says ""leave me alone"" like a giant pair of headphones blasting Kendrick Lamar"
Anybody who works in a shop for a living should check out 3M worktunes.
"Wireless is pretty nice sometimes. I can get up and go to the bathroom without touching my headphones, marginally improving my day."
Watch Linus review of the Airpod max they are not worth the money!!!!
The only reason I see ever getting wireless headphones of ANY sort is because I could get away with wearing them at work under a hat. Otherwise there are 0 positives.
"You apparently don't know about transparency mode. You don't have to take the pros or the maxes off your head to hear people better.

also, the lack of cord is a plus for walking around. I constantly had wired headphones get tugged out of my ears by the weight of the cord, or the cord getting caught on everything. never had the issue with wireless headphones."
It looks like you're wearing makeup in this video and you've left a good chunk of it under your right eye.
You should make a video on Mother Teresa. She's basically Mother Teresa!
Was that a White Noise reference?
Surprised he didn't mention the scientifically-verified cancer-causing radiation levels that come from leaving them on for more than an hour at a time...
"I hate apple, but I love my AirPods.

Problem: They are SUPER easy to lose.
My personal experience: I never lose either of my AirPods, I keep them in my watchpocket when I have to take them out to do something."
Where’d you get that blue jacket tho
Tinfoil Things NEEDS to be a thing... He makes TOO MUCH sense...
Apple do sell AirPods individually just call apple are but left or right or the case .
"I genuinely believe that people who buy apple products have less inteligence than the rest of the people
they're more expensive and have lower quality than it's competitors, and they're worse-looking, 
I have xiaomi Airdots for 2 years and never have a problem, their batteries are still better than ever, and it is literarly 10x cheaper than the airpods , it's direct competitor in quality (although the Airdots have better quality, as they fit better in the ears and are almost impossible to fall out."
"This video honestly seems like it’s just berating wireless headphones (not just airpods) for no reason. Like the ‘fumbling to take them off’, what??? This is literally a non issue, most wireless headphones will either be non noise isolating or will have a transparency mode, so you literally can keep them in while you talk to someone. Also, you pretend that wired headphones have literally no drawbacks, but they have huge issues like tangling or catching on doorknobs and stuff. Wired is also far more fragile since the cable can be (and often is) damaged due to how thin it is. It’s obviously a trade off because of charging and the higher possibility of loss, but it’s a tradeoff that most people seem to be more than willing to make based on sales numbers and just by walking down the street."
actually they are lucky steve died otherwise it would be proprietary everything at apple... o wait...

"I just don't understand why people like the solid plastic instead of flexible earbuds? Do you find them comfortable? They have always hurt my ears so so much, how do anybody find them comfortable? Seriously, I don't feel like I have weird ears but clearly most people have a different shaped ear than me"

"Airpods look shitty. They seem weak (sound is not so bad how it looks). But look is like cheap small headphones- certainly more for talks than for music.

They have shitty batteries - 2h call is too long for them"

"I enjoy your content so much that I watched every video on your and I want more


Also..... Nice humor"
when i lost one i had the option to just buy one airpod for $60
Hot water bottles or tables would be interesting ordinary things!
Finally someone is actually saying what they think
"I buy a new phone once every five years, so it's not that expensive."
"Never paid the full price for any Apple product.
Huawei and Android for the win."
Apple sells them seperate now if you give them the serial number theyre like 90 bucks for a new one so please dont just go buy a new set lol.
I only just noticed I've watched practically every video on this channel in about a week or 2
Thanks for solidifying my hatred for apple +1
"I would like you to do an ordinary things on toilets, just so I can hear you say ""terlot"" more."

@ 3:05 Are you absolutely sure about this? Cos I lost one in my pair and bought just that one I lost. For less than a half of price.
"$500 for a pair of earbuds that just so happen to be made by an overrated company? 

you can buy a pair of studio headphones for that price"
I only hope the generations below us realize the trash quality of these overhyped goods.

I love AirBuds.

Me watching this video with Sony wireless headphones.
Good thing am listing this video on my AirPods
As an avid wearer of headphones the airpods never appealed to me (I HATE in ear headphones) and the airpod max looks flimsy as fuck :/ I would not pay £20 for them - just look at that headband and imagine how easy it'd be to just snap them in half without even trying. Awful.
You can get single airpods actually

You should make a video about robinhood and reddit.  And what happened to the stockmarket.

"Fuck wired head phones....I use my HP's 8-9 hours a day at work, and under those conditions the wires break from anywhere from a week to 3 months tops, took 1 pair back to the shop 9 times in a year, so a good pair of wireless headphones are great,  but fuck Ipods @£100+ a pair when there is much better products to be had for way cheaper, you do have to sift through the shit to find em but they are around."
Why can I only like this once?

Why the fuck did you buy airpods?
Apple SUUUUUCKS!
"I was reluctant at first, but honestly AirPods are my favorite apple products"
"For someone as intelligent and well-researched as yourself, I was shocked to hear you mispronounce “nuclear.”"
Tbh airpods are a really nice product the wired never fitted my ears and fell out like everytime
"After years of dealing with annoying wires that tangle themselves up, I caved and bought a pair of Airpods around the end of last year, and yes, I have dropped one into the toilet by accident."
"Never liked the look of 'em. When I first saw them I thought, ""Why do people want to look like they have broken Q-tips in their ears?"". I still think that. If Apple hadn't released them, I'm not sure they would have been very popular just on the looks."
A friend of mine bought airpods for the meme so he could ironically flex his earphones
I always liked the corded headphones because I can hang them off the front of my shirt if I need to talk to someone
"Apple does sell them individually, you just gotta contact them lol"
2021 and I still use a headphone jack. Lol true wireless is fine for podcasts and casual listening but I didn't spend a bunch of money on corded headphones just to have them go to waste
watching this the day after i finally got my right airpod pro back after dropping it down a elevator shaft for a month
was an apple user for about 10 years. Happy I switched to Samsung ngl. the S10 is a solid phone
i have a 10 dollar pair of earbuds i got from walmart they normally break after a month or so but i got a pair thats lasted 3 years and still using them i dont know why people spend so much for stuff like that
I bought the Samsung wireless headphones dropped it in a bucket of sealer at work sprayed it off and it broke. Still somewhat usable I eventually lost it and then lost the carrying case finally found it though don't know where the case is. For that following Christmas my father got me a pair of $20 skull candies just a wire for your neck and told me buy them cheap because you will break them and he is 100% right I've dropped said skull candies in sealer and sprayed them off dozens of times the sound quality is still the same. I paid 1/10 the price of the Samsungs to get myself a second pair when I forget the main one by cheap headphones because the more expensive ones use the same components as the cheap ones and since there's so many of them out on the market the cheap ones are able to be even cheaper and better quality.
"Not only are my cheapo amazon buds 1/4 the price of airpods, they'll also sell you individual replacements, checkmate apple."
8:02 you can take air pods out and hold them in your hand... it’s not that hard. But this isn’t a hate comment I do really like your channel and am binge watching all of you videos
Shoot I’ve watched all the episodes... make more
"You forgot to talk about how the batteries shit the bed after just a few months, and you cant replace them. So toss them in the trash and buy a whole new set!!! Also, they'll sit in a landfill and destroy the environment because they're near impossible to recycle! Yay Apple!"
This guy is hilarious!
"Me, listening with my (amazing and awesome) AirPods: "
I have a gut feeling this guy will smash the next pair of airpods he see's
"I kid you not, the exact moment that he threw the AirPod in the toilet, my left earbud disconnected"
Listening to this through my AirPods actually
"airpods pro is actually good tws considering who actually made them. while apm, at that price, is a joke. The apm is nothing more than a bass cannon with a few gimmick... for 550$. if you want APM, then get a bose qc35ii, they sound much better."

Not trying to talk trash. But can you do a video explaining your hair?
im surprised you didnt mention the permanent beam of bluetooth zapping from one airpod through your brain to the other
"I lost one of mine and went to the Apple store and was able to buy just one, this was before the wireless charger"
"2:55
no.
i've purchased a single airpod once from apple's support
they're like 50$ out of warranty though and a pain in the ass to pair"
I worked as a driving instructor for one summer. The kids may as well have had airpods instead of ears.
"Been watching a few of your videos and I do like them, but gotta disagree with you here. There is much to critique Apple about, and for some products there is an Apple tax, but for other there is not, for example their computers (except the Mac Pro) and their low end phones (for the specs they offer) are very competitively priced. Their newest ARM computers are the best bang you can get for your buck. Are the AirPods overpriced? I dunno, don't know much about sound, wifi and syncing technology, do you? You don't sound like you do. Yeah, you can argue you don't need that stuff with a wire, but if wireless didn't matter they wouldn't be so popular. I don't own AirPods, but do own wireless headset and see the appeal. Now going after Apple for other business practices like the 'Ecosystem' and Chinese labor is fair game, but this is about AirPods specifically, so that's where I'm going to keep my critiques as well."
I’m glad I don’t own AirPods and instead bought an $25 amazon alternative that do the job just as well
"I don’t get it, I’ve had a pair of $50 over the head Bluetooth headphones since 2016 and the only damage they’ve taken is a crack in the plastic on top of the headband, plus I can’t drop them down to turlet"
"Hes super right . Head phones fucking destroy the social exp at my WP, I chit chat with my workspace mate and he gets passed sometime bc he has to remove his headphones,  so sad  work is such a lonely place bc of headphones"
Apple does sell it individually through the genius bar.
I got a pair of wireless bluetooth earbuds so I can wear them under a beanie at work without getting in trouble. They were a tenner off eBay and have good bass. Airpods are dumb
"Wait, you're telling me airpods were more than a joke and an actual product that some numbskull actually paid money for?

Can't beat a walkman."
They do sell them individually. It also happened to me.
"this is probably the first video from your channel that i didn't liked, the acting part and the exaggeration in the anger when doing them didn't work well to me, but the information and the research part of the video was good as always"
I use 10 dollar onn wireless headphones from  Walmart. I've lost about 3 pairs in a year and keep an un open new set in my back pack just in case  I lose them. The fit under my motorcycle  helmet and work great  500 dollars my ass
Every new Apple product is just “you thought that last one was taking the piss? Whatch this!”
"I got two pairs that were found. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t want them even as a gift. Not really worth it."
Yeah headphones with jacks were much simpler times
I never bought in to that i brand BS. Smfh. I mean if always buying the next model phone makes you happy then go for it. Lmao.
"Just FYI for whoever, Apple...does sell replacement AirPods individually...."
ok but how are you actually meant to clean out these little earwax collectors
"apple isn't even the first to have a monthly plan for airpods max's, nuraphone has a monthly payment plan lmao"
Proud to be a Patron...although I do like AirPods!
"3:35 For the longest time, I thought Bluetooth was invented in 2008 oop..."
"Airpod lanyards... had to search for it on Etsy.  Actually found earrings to keep AirPods from dropping in toilets.   Whaaaaa, ha ha ha ha."
"Anonymous Apple Employee reporting in. They'll replace your missing earpiece.... for $69 (nice), and a $6.95 shipping fee .So it's not /that/ bad :P, for literally half of the cost of the entire product you can replace one earpiece."
"My airpods have already gone through the washer and dryer, twice"
"Using my AirPods for three years hadn’t lost them, but the battery starts dying"
ive never bought an apple product in my life
Personally i think wireless earbuds are too good for stuff like working out to pass up. That being said im never going to buy apple's shitpods and much rather use cheaper alternatives i can find on the internet
"When my earbud falls out while I’m working, it hangs down on the wire and I merely put it back in. I don’t want fucking air pods :/"
Mine were fine for years till i lost em two weeks ago
In CA you can get 1 replacement AirPod for about $60
Never owned an Apple product. Not planning to either.
"Apple: we don't think brain is part of a good human, so we don't have it"
"My mate dropped his airpods down my other mates recliner sofa and they and the case got jammed in a hole. We found, after about 45 mins of looking for them and trying to get them out we found they were crushed and destroyed.  This was after only having them for 2 days and when he took them back he was told by apple that he would have to buy new ones. He had 'FULL WARRANTY'.  And that's why I dont buy apple products. SAD"
you need to look into who mother teresa actually was.
Apple does sell them individually doe
Headphones are superior to earbuds anyways.
Actually a good youtube recommendation
Except you can order separate AirPod buds if you are foolish or careless enough to lose them right from Apple ...
Apple does sell them individually
Love this video and the channel! But what is the Sam hell is that moisture nibblet under your right eye??
We should start making fun of people who use apple products
Watched this on my iPhone with my airpods
i can flex my campfire audio andromeda that cost $1000 but normies don't know that
Hi Maybe for your next video you should do something about conspiracy theories but chem trails in particular.
"6:58 noooooooooo. It’s nuclear. Not nukuuulllarrrrr. :(

It’s also not called the nukules. It’s nucleus. Just in case."
Wired headphones forever.
AirPods Pro beat any of these points
What did your hair do to deserve this?
I mean they do sell them separately
I’ve always thought they looked like tampons
I would use earbuds with wires IF I DIDN'T BUY THE THE HUAWEI P20 PRO which DOESN'T have an aux input and the aux adapter I got with the phone got chewed up by my cat........and that there's a lot of dust in the charger hole which makes it unstable when charging or putting anything in there.
This video is sponsored by Raycon Earbuds!
The Airpods headset thing is a Parrot Zik clone.
You can buy them individually
now people will look like cybermen instead of people with cigarettes in there ears.
Omg it's the Stede Bonnet himself!
oh my god the airpod supremacy was 2 years ago
You should try doing toothbrushes
"""Sound snakes"""
can you do a video on plastic companies
The thing that I hate the most about AirPods are the people saying how good and comfortable they are even though they look and feel like those old ass earphones from 15-20 years ago made from hard plastic that made your ears and head hurt after like 15min.
"I dont care mate, airpods pro are fucking good and sit nicely in the ear. Dont have to take them out when someone is talking to you."
"EarPods and AirPods aren’t comfortable to me. I dislike them.... I use a JBL brand wireless earbuds. It’s comfortable, works just as well and are cheaper. 

As someone with autism and severe ADD/ADHD I need earbuds when I go out."
I don’t want this future I like the USB ports they are reliable
"Showed you to my friends and then they stopped liking me
. Definintly not a coincidence, they have no taste."
I loved you in Queen's Gambit.
"4:49 Aaaah there you are, Traveler..."
long live wires
Can you do one about Diet Sodas?
"normemes, thats why I never cared about memes, could easily see how it would get infected by the generic populace"
"HOLY SHIT, 344K SUBSCRIBERS. Last time I was here you had like, 10K."
The real crime against the head is that hair.
Ohhh so that’s what happened to the kid from Hugo
"Why do you pronounce nuclear as ""nook-queue-lar""?! Just made my ears bleed"
Also air pods hurt your ears
I love you and I love your videos thank you but is your pronunciation of nuclear as nucular a running gag. Sorry I am new. LOVE YOu
lost a single airpod today
This whole video is about shit everybody already knew
"Did anyone else get the ""magic sex gun"" ad?"
Oh shit internet historians bro blowing up
xD who’s watching this on an apple product
Who wants to pay extra to microwave your brain?
ill stick to a cable.
So basically I have foud the nakeyjakey of random shit on yt ...and I love it???
I got the pros and when I see people with the AirPods I’m like fucking pleb I hate the AirPods I like the in ear.
Dr. Beats are the worst ear/headphones. expensive and sounds like 5 dollar pair
Lol I'm heart this on airpods
A big reason I don't like apple
"""Why did we remove the headphone jack?""

Because you're sociopaths, that's why."
"I'm sorry, but the airpods max look uglier than my Sennheisers and likely perform like crap."
complaining ab airpods in current year lol heres ur reddit gold
5:24 among us reffrence

"poor sound quality of apple crap isnt discussed. Apple headphones sound terrible, all of them"

Man just tryna be drippy 
Dude are u the guy who ride around in a shoe?

“We’re so brave to deny people ease of access to listening to earbuds”.
I prefer wired compared to wireless anyday. Bluetooth sucks dick."
I watched this while listening through my AirPods and it made the video that much better.
6:26 I've got those and the noise cancelling is pretty nice :)
"they do sell airpods individually though :/
you just have to contact them, they have pricing for individual parts on their website"
"Dont like apple, but my experience with airpods is pretty good"
"Ok I'm watching this with both of my airpods lost.. except for my old 3rd airpod which I found after I replaced both of them.

Hm. Maybe he has a point."
"Yeah, my mom can't stop using hers. Basically Apple got to her.
and my android phone came with no headphone jack and was mortified once I found out I can't use my old reliable headphones on it."
My $40 earbuds from Amazon have been great for the last 2 years now
Wait until he finds out about the AirPods Max Aluminum Condensation disaster.
"I saw a guys airpod fall on the floor out his goddamn ear, he had to put his floor bud back in his ear
I was embarrassed for him
Honestly you can get some VERY good normal headphones for that price"
"Tbh when the max was trending on Twitter when it was first announced, I thought it was a meme. Like an over priced wireless headset being announced like it’s new in some way? I thought I was a joke "
"Not gonna lie, I like mine  they were a gift tho

Somehow managed not to lose them in 1yr"
"i didnt know beats was bought out by apple but that makes sense considering both of their products and marketing strategies is to take the lowest quality piece of chinese plastic, slap a 500$ sticker price on it and sell it to the most braindead mob of people on the planet
its actually pretty funny, ive spent maybe 10-15$ on earbuds that had infinitely more dynamic audio drivers that dont make it sound like ur music is coming out of a toiletbowl"
love your vids! keep it up!
8:45 - Says the bloke who admits in the beginning of the video he has bought AirPods TM. I just love how that's this channel in a nutshell.
"I love your content but... This got to me. Bluetooth is a thirty year old technology... Unix is fifty. And Unix is the kernal that runs Mac and iOS. Software gets updated dude. Bluetooth has had MANY versions, and is honestly an immense topic you could cover in one of your future videos. Please make this right."
"AirPods Max.... they're just headphones. Yep.
KEEP DRINKING THE APPLE JUICE, SHEEPLE"
my ears are tiny and the airpods/earpods form factor are the only thing that fit (in-ear headphones legit hurt.) never have had an airpod drop out of my ear once.
"Ooh yes the two things I hate the most, AirPods and ordinary things!"
"I agree with this video but I still want a pair, idk why, but I do."
Listening to this with my AirPods
My biggest beef with Apple is they call their workers genuises. If they were truly geniuses why the fuck would they waste their time doing retail? Lol.
"If you go on a plane, you can get headphones for free"
"i for my self like them, not Airpods specific but cablefree headphones. 
simply cause the Cables on my regular headphones allways break after  a short time. ALLWAYS... no matter how expensive the headphones are."
Apple is going to remove the charging port from phone. So they can sell their wireless chargers. Source : Marquees Brownlee.
AirPods is actually good.
Listening to this with airpods 
Sound snakes will now be a part of my regular vocabulary
wireless headphones are a sin
Imagine supporting Apple lmao
Watching this using AirPods lmao
I can't believe people are still complaining about wireless earphones.
I'll stick to my Audio-Technica M50x's thanks
the pro are amazing as they have noise cancelling and you don't have to have to worry about a fucking bullshit wire ripping your pods out of your ears when slightly moving your arm jut put them in and you're good to go
"I like my 3.5 jack, thank you, get that wireless stuff outta here..."
You can buy an individual airpod through repair
How are British people the best at coming up with a million names for the same thing?
Am I the only one who’s always hated apple’s headphones?? Like I’ve never found them comfortable at all (even before they switched to the ear pod shape) they feel all around cheap and the sound quality isn’t that great.
I’m watching this with AirPods
"You know that prank people used to do, where they would put a bucket of yellow paint on top of a door so that it would fall on someone's head when they opened the door?
Anyway, just reminiscing, no connection whatsoever to this video."
There are wired wireless Airport!
I believe the kids call anything wired Boomer tech
Apple does sell AirPods individually if you call support
Quickly become one of my favorite YouTubers
Airpods pro are honestly the best
I love my AirPods
"wireless headphones are, in principle, cool. what is nOT cool is removing the abilty to use ANY OTHER headphones, and then making them 160 dollars and as soon as you lose or break one, you have to purchase a whole new set. that alone makes me so mad, i will on principle never own anything from apple. i refuse. get away from me ghost of steve apple jobs lmao"
where did you get your giant airpod???
you can't just show a video of a girl being snatched under a bed and not explain it
"also just because you can buy anything apple related doesn't mean your rich
basically every flagship phone cost a grand
every wireless earbud cost 100+
and macbooks are just a ripoff, your better off buying a gaming laptop or better yet building a PC that is 10x more powerful"
Lol I liked when you hit yourself and it hurt
FYI apple does sell them individually.
"I disagree the price gives ""exclusivity"" no phone carriers make you pay for it all at once (at least ones that I am in) I buy apple because they are amazing products. Android is knock-off apple lmaooooooooo"
"found mine as a waiter 
first gen tho"
"I hate many companies, but I think it is Apple that I hate the most out of all.

Their fans are also the worst."
"Main reason why all of this suck is: Bluetooth headphones is shit and you cant do anything about it. When you use regular headphones encoded (lossy) signal is decoded and then converted via DAC (which is can be good or bad) into analog signal and sent via wire to headphones which can be also good or bad. When its bluetooth thing encoded signal is decoded and then ENCODED again using lossy codec - SBC in worst case and aptX in best scenario. When it sent on air, decoded in headphones and by using tiny DAC converted to analog and sent to whatever quality membranes your thing have."
Me watching this with air pods
"also, headphones are better on ya ears :)"
What is volume normalization for $500
"6:58 Bro you really gotta stop pronouncing nuclear as ""nucular""..."
I'll stick with my Trekz Aftershokz

"my airpods work flawlessly (: never lost them ever, never had a problem at all"
me watching this with airpods
Ig Steve Jobs had the right idea about the iPad not supporting flash tho seeing that flash is dead now
“This video is sponsored by Raycon”
"hey tbh ima get wireless headphones.   :/ also, i wasn’t gonna airpods  any ways."
thank you! i fucking hate airpods
"I hate Apple. I hate wires more. Getting rid of wires for Bluetooth just makes sense. Move along.

""They didn't have batteries..."" Yes, they did. The battery was just in the iPhone. Move along."
You're Thoughts2's goofy cousin
"But that’s your totally subjective take, i don’t have any, or the problems you mentioned don’t bother me"

I LITERALLY WAS PUTTING MINE AWAY IN THEIR CASE at 8:05 WTF
"Yeah, well, that's just like, your opinion, man."
Long story short. They are overpriced
I don't know what's more of a cult. Apple fanboys or people that hate apple
Toasters reference <3
I quite like my airpods

Audio engineer says wire good
the most disgusting thing about taking airpods off is touching the faint freshly melty wax on them
Please upload more
I hate these simply because they make my ears hurt like hell. Have no idea how people can wear these for more than 5 minutes. They look and feel like cheap $5 earphones you got in the 90s or something..
what've you got under your right eye there?
Yeah! For all of us
"I'm a shallow bitch and I just find the aesthetic of airpods to be super ugly, so...it's a nope from me as well"
I love your hair!
"6:57 Nice pronunciation,  GW"
Planned obsolescence
"Is this Tom Scott, but hipster?"
What's under your eye?  You ok?
Can I have a muffin?
Where is that music from?? It's driving me crazy
If you want a funny Australian to let u know some ideas for headphones earpods etc. Check out dank pods on yt
I refuse to get this pointless waste of money. It’s a step backwards

Imagine buying those overpriced garbage. Unreal.
"7:02
Only 130?"
I honestly don’t like AirPods or earbuds at all!!!!  I like headphones instead!!!!
I’m watching this with Raycons 
"whats with the term earpods, theyre not ears, nor pods."
"Wow you had like 5 k subscribers and were talking about onions, what happened? You’re so boogie now"
2:58 DOWN THE TERLET
You got some interesting eye lens why the tiny ring in the middle?
why do i love you so much
"I think apple earbuds either wired or wireless suck. The noise isolation sucks, they fit in your ear uncomfortably, and they're critically overpriced."
Two ads in under 5 minutes? That's a dislike. Also clickbait title. 6 minutes in now and haven't heard a single thing about 'crimes against the head'.
I love everything about this video and I hate everything about your hair
I never seen your videos and I thought u were pew die pie in the thumbnail lol
the only people that like apple are vegans that like to smell their own farts and hope to drive a tesla someday
Way too many ads dude
airpoops
Did you green screen your hair or something
"could you not say sus, you sound like my 7 year old cousin"
Your head salad
do Golf lol
wtf is that thing at 0:43?
Worship algorithim
Galaxy Buds are way better than airpods. They are smaller and sound better.
I’ve had my AirPods for a year now and I’ve never lost them. Honestly idk how people lose them.
"I remember during my freshman year of high school I got the first wave of AirPods and was one of the only ones with them so people made fun of me ( I’m an anti-Social and introverted person) so I got the around the neck wire to make them look more normal I had one of them around my neck and the other in my ear when I looked down I had lost the other one, I looked everywhere to find it , but no luck. During softmore and junior year everyone had them if only they knew I was the original"
Man I remember when I got my first AirPods before they blew up in popularity and people made fun of them in high school.
Thankfully the first and last Apple product I had was an Apple IIc.
I’m so glad this video exists I have been hating AirPods for the longest time
20 years ago Apple products were overpriced and offered very little practicality or compatibility. Nothing has changed.
Love how you make fun of apple fanboys for buying everything they release... just after admitting to buying two pairs of airpods
"Haven't ever spent a dollar on apple products, and proud of it"
I watch YouTube in the living room on the tv or on my phone without headphones or earbuds. Better for hearing
apple does sell them individually. you have to message their customer service
"Me listening to this on my wireless over head headphones that I payed like 50 pounds for cause I went independent, also they're noise cancelling which I can turn off. The moral of this story just buy a lesser known brand and for once this isn't a plug for Raicon cuase I have self respect."
"Whats weird is i have had beats, airpods, and bose... my reycons have been more reliable with better sound quality. Just remember to pull that screen out and clean off the ear wax haha."
I just want aux ports on phones back. I always lose the adapter for it :(
"Imagine buying expensive Apple products without knowing the one that assembled it was bunch of children in China who's being forced slavery because they can't go to school.

Well looks like 2021 is just like 2020 but part 2, what a good start xD"
Imagine not being able to afford the cord
"wait people actually bought airpods? I barely ever see them here in Germany.

one classmate had them a year or two back and we lowkey making fun of him because they look god damn stupid"
"Got airpods for free and use them on android. I'm not a fan of the apple hype, but also not of the bashing. Who flippin cares?

Awesome channel tho!"
"me watching this video with my airpods 
 Me: Oh no that's scary"
tbh glad i got airpods cus I would ALWAYS break any wired earbud I touched within 2 months
I bought earbuds because it was easier to listen to music while exercising
if only people knew how much these products cost to manufacture
"Bro I Love your videos, I have been watched all your videos, keep up with great work. "
I still use my IPhone X till this year while every apple employee is panicking over the fact I have a phone that more than a year old
7:24 I love conspiracy theorist ordinary things LMAO
It feels weird watching this video with airpods connected to a samsung phone
Finally he’s back
But... apple does sell them individually
"I've got no strings to hold me down
To make me fret, or make me frown
I had strings, but now I'm free
There are no strings on me~"
Is it ironic to listen to this on AirPods?
or loose one under the back seat of your lyft drivers car. Then he finds it later after a child has exploded all over the back seat and he has to remove said back seat to shampoo it then finds some of the craziest shit ever. Apple should engrave these things with the customers name  and phone number on them so they can be returned easily.
I'm glad I'm not the only person that noticed all this I've had so many argument about this and no one seems to get it that I know
"Yeah. Apple innovated with the smart phone... everything else, to me is a bit meh. I'm sticking to Samsung. ^^"
I bought a dongle today 
"The apple brick for $627, dongle included"
Air Pod pros are kind of great though...
"No mention of the slave labor?
Maybe not a good thing for the algorithm...
Nontheless, great vid man
Nothing truly beats wires in the end~"
So I happen to get some AirPods gifted to me which yes was very fortunate and I was very greatful only to put them on for the first time to watch some YouTube and immediately see this video... I have no idea what to expect but I’m already concerned
apple peasants always make me feel better about myself
Honestly expected him to throw in a sponsored by ray con ad lol
"for 160 dolars , you can buy medium range studio headphones, and airpods sound like  normal headphones that cost 40$ - like dogpoo"
4 ads in a 10 minute video from our YouTube overlords. Might be time for me to join your Patreon and avoid this nonsense.
"Fuck imagine having a company which makes money of the premise that the company sells expensive goods, thats fucking crazy. What an easy mode company. Like if you had to simulate it for a videogame and the game was like business tycoon or something.

Yes i am high"
What's the piano music that starts at 07:26 called? I love it!
I listen to this with air pods 
I prefer wire headphones too. That's just me.
They do sell replacement single airpods.
Flash actually was cancer though getting rid of that was a good decision.
AirPods good; W I R E S  B A D
Yea but if u don’t wear Airpods what u gonna wear? Headphones? 
Apple sells single airpod replacements homie
listening to this on my airpods
"I see, a man of wire as well"
i had megalovania open in another tab and i thought it just turned on magically
Holy crap how did you go from less than 10k views to 200k views in like 6 months?

Wasted 180$ on AirPods Pro
Me watching this with airpods:
YESSS another video!!! :DDDD
"They do sell then separately wtf u lost my AirPods Pro left headphone , and i bought a new one for like 150 Eu"
"You CAN buy only one AirPod, I know because I did, you need to go to the apple store but still, it’s possible"
But what about the cancer claims floating around on the internet
"You have q tips in your ears...

$30 gets you the same thing but sleeker"
Ayyy ive got the Sony ones that you showed
I was watching this vid while wearing an AirPod
the entire concept of a lifestyle product is dumb. if you buy something for that reason you need to adjust your priorities in life. it's really foolish. you can do better.
i just don't like how earbuds feel
Imagine my shock
Might I suggest toothpaste?
"Hey Ordinary Things, where did last names come from?"
"Buys Air Pods.
Literally cannot get them in. They are too big & hurt & keep popping out.
Clean & give to brother.
Cat steals them & makes them chew toys."
I am listening to this video with airpods
But they sell the individual AirPod
Do a video on the economics of Mr Beast
Haha amateurs i tape the wires directly to my brain neurons So i never wear the Air pods
"I am more piss that the head phone jack was murdered, the only reason people ever gave me was ""but making it water proof with headphone jack is hard"" BITCH if it is hard then it better, removing a phone part to make companies lives easier is just dumb."
7:03 over 130?? Apple moving big weight
"Call emplemon, we got a downward spiral"
I have been telling everyone that!!
JUST PUT IT IN MY FECCKIN BRAIN
Fun vid
over 130 wireless headphones
"This guy is a freak, but good videos"
In Germany we’re able to replace a lost AirPod on it’s own. Why the fuck isn’t that possible in great old MURICA?
man beats self with enlarged electric toothbrush
Sounding pretty boomer tbh
I have AirPods 
Wait... do you have a pink screen?
your sow fucking underrated you deserv mutch more subs
Apple is expensive trash. Yes I knew that but I don't see anything negative besides preference in earbuds vs cables. This video was just a rant that you dislike earbuds with a title that was not adressed at all and tbh it was stretched like a mofo to 10 minutes.
"Your hair keeps getting wilder.

I like it?"
ive missed you
happy new year buddy
Your hair is a crime against the head
I don't like wireless PC mice either.
Didn’t you have 2k subs like a week ago oh my god

"Apple, corpo gonks."
"ill be honest, im not gay whatsoever and dont plan on it. but golly change this world lmoaoo."

"7 ads, 5 before 5 minute mark."
Also latency is terrible with wireless
"I just don't get it, they look awful and sound meh for the price, why do people buy them??"
Where the hell have you been lol?
Why did it take you 4 weeks to make 1 video
Happy 2021
"Don’t mind me, just listening to this on air pods."
300k subs?!
What is under your eye?
ordinary's face kinda annoys me
Downwirl spiral
I hate apple so much.
Please can you sort that hair out. Nice idea but its too yellow. We all know you've got the money so what you waiting for?

You look like PogChamp dude lol
